abstract={The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a key standard for monitoring the activity regularity of heart. Many cardiac abnormalities will be demonstrated from ECG including arrhythmia, which may be a life-threatening disease. Automatic classification of arrhythmias is one of the most valuable topics in medicine and bioinformatics. we develop a baseline network (network A) and a multi-scale fusion CNN architecture (network B) based on network A to automatically identify five different types of heartbeats in ECG signals. We also design multi-scale signal, including the signals of 250 sample (set A) and 360 sample (set B), which is fed into set B. Our experiment is conducted in set A and set B derived from a publicly available database MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITAB). An average accuracy of 92.81%, a sensitivity and specificity of 95.84%, 93.92% respectively is obtained using network A. Meanwhile, an average accuracy of 95.48%, a sensitivity and specificity of 96.53%, 87.74% respectively is obtained using network B. The results demonstrate that multi-scale fusion CNN architecture (network B) is slightly better than network A due to adding a convolution block consist of three convolution layers, which aggregate the feature from all the convolution branches. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model can be leveraged as a rapid tool to identify different types of arrhythmias.},

abstract={Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an efficient and commonly used tool for detecting arrhythmias. With the development of dynamic ECG monitoring, an effective and simple algorithm is needed to deal with large quantities of ECG data. In this study, we proposed a method to detect multiple arrhythmias based on time-frequency analysis and convolutional neural networks. For a short-time (10 s) single-lead ECG signal, the time-frequency distribution matrix of the signal was first obtained using a time-frequency transform method, and then a convolutional neural network was used to discriminate the rhythm of the signal. ECG data in multiple databases were used and were divided into 12 classes. Finally, the performance of three kinds of time-frequency transform methods are evaluated, including short-time Fourier transform (STFT), continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (PWVD). The best result was obtained by STFT, with an accuracy of 96.65%, an average sensitivity of 96.47%, an average specificity of 99.68%, and an average F1 score of 96.27%, respectively. Especially, the area under curve (AUC) value is 0.9987. The proposed method in this work may be efficient and valuable to detect multiple arrhythmias for dynamic ECG monitoring.},

abstract={Body area networks, including smart sensors, are widely reshaping health applications in the new era of smart cities. To meet increasing security and privacy requirements, physiological signalbased biometric human identification is gaining tremendous attention. This paper focuses on two major impediments: the signal processing technique is usually both complicated and data-dependent and the feature engineering is time-consuming and can fit only specific datasets . To enable a data-independent and highly generalizable signal processing and feature learning process, a novel wavelet domain multiresolution convolutional neural network is proposed. Specifically, it allows for blindly selecting a physiological signal segment for identification purpose, avoiding the complicated signal fiducial characteristics extraction process. To enrich the data representation, the random chosen signal segment is then transformed to the wavelet domain, where multiresolution time-frequency representation is achieved. An auto-correlation operation is applied to the transformed data to remove the phase difference as the result of the blind segmentation operation. Afterward, a multiresolution 1-D-convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN) is introduced to automatically learn the intrinsic hierarchical features from the wavelet domain raw data without datadependent and heavy feature engineering, and perform the user identification task. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is thoroughly evaluated on eight electrocardiogram datasets with diverse behaviors, such as with or without severe heart diseases, and with different sensor placement methods. Our evaluation is much more extensive than the state-of-the-art works, and an average identification rate of 93.5% is achieved. The proposed multiresolution 1-D-CNN algorithm can effectively identify human subjects, even from randomly selected signal segments and without heavy feature engineering. This paper is expected to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of applying the blind signal processing and deep learning techniques to biometric human identification, to enable a low algorithm engineering effort and also a high generalization ability.},

abstract={Arrhythmia indicates abnormal sources of electrical impulses in the heart or abnormalities in any conductive process. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most popular tool for detecting arrhythmia as it is non-invasive and effective. As visual inspection is difficult and tedious, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is developed to provide medical decision supports. In this study, a method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to automated classify heartbeat of arrhythmia. Compared with conventional machine learning methods, CNN requires no additional feature extraction or feature selection processes. The ECG signal is segmented and then the heartbeats are inputted to the model directly. The structure of CNN in this study is improved. In one convolution layer, kernels with different sizes are used simultaneously. Afterward, the max-pooling operation is applied to the feature maps. Finally, the feature maps generated by kernels with different sizes are concatenated and inputted to the fully-connected layers. The method was employed on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and an accuracy of 98.73% was obtained. A comparative experiment was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={The study in this paper presents a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) model, designed for the automated detection of obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) captured from single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The system provides mechanisms in clinical practice that help diagnose patients suffering with OSA. Using the state-of-the-art in 1DCNNs, a model is constructed using convolutional, max pooling layers and a fully connected Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) consisting of a hidden layer and SoftMax output for classification. The 1DCNN extracts prominent features, which are used to train an MLP. The model is trained using segmented ECG signals grouped into 5 unique datasets of set window sizes. 35 ECG signal recordings were selected from an annotated database containing 70 night-time ECG recordings. (Group A – a01 to a20 (Apnoea breathing), Group B – b01 to b05 (moderate), and Group C – c01 to c10 (normal). A total of 6514 minutes of Apnoea was recorded. Evaluation of the model is performed using a set of standard metrics which show the proposed model achieves high classification results in both training and validation using our windowing strategy, particularly W=500 (Sensitivity=0.9705, Specificity=0.9725, F1_Score=0.9717, Kappa_Score=0.9430, Log_Loss=0.0836, ROCAUC=0.9945).

abstract={As part of the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017, this work focuses on the classification of a single channel short electrocardiogram (ECG) signal into normal, atrial fibrillation (AF), others and noise classes. To this end, we propose a shallow convolutional neural network architecture which learns suitable features pertaining to each class while eliminating the need to extract the traditionally used ad hoc features. In particular, we first developed a robust R-peak detector and stacked sequence of fixed number of detected beats with R-peaks aligned. These stack of beats corresponding to a segment of ECG record are classified into one of the four aforementioned classes. To improve the robustness, multiple classifiers were trained to classify these segments. Overall record classification was then generated using an voting scheme from the classification results of individual segments. Our best submission result during the official phase has a score of 71% with F1 scores of 86%, 73% and 56% respectively for normal, AF and other classes respectively.},

abstract={In this paper, seizure activities of EEG signals have been detected exploiting 1-D convolutional neural network architecture of deep learning algorithm. In past some years, many algorithms have been developed for seizure detection. Traditional method of seizure detection includes manual feature selection and classifier separately. In recent years, convolutional neural network architecture of deep learning gets very much popularity in place of traditional method. Though, very few works of convolutional neural network are found in literature for one dimensional signal classification. However, one dimensional EEG and ECG signal classifications are necessary to detect and investigate diseases like seizure activity, sleep apnea or arrhythmia and so on. The proposed method of one dimensional EEG signal classification for epileptic seizure detection involves the smallest and simplest 1-D convolutional neural network architecture for automated feature selection. The projected architecture is implemented to detect several kinds of seizure and non-seizure EEG signals and found achieving greater accuracy and sensitivity in comparison to that acquired by state-of-the-art methods involving manual feature selection and the identical EEG dataset.},

abstract={According to a study by the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality across the world. Nearly 17.9 million deaths each year are due to CVDs, which equates to 31 % of all deaths worldwide. An estimated 85% of these deaths are caused by heart attack or stroke. Cardiac Arrhythmia is a major disorder humans' experience which can lead to fatal conditions such as Cardiac Arrest or Stroke. Unless it is tested by a physician, one cannot discern if he/she has Arrhythmia because of its asymptomatic nature in some cases. An Electrocardiogram (ECG) is commonly used to check a patient's heart rhythm. In this paper, our focus is to present a method through which Cardiac Arrhythmia can be detected and classified in real-time by a wearable ECG device.

abstract={Pilot workload monitoring plays an important role in aviation safety. Heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiration rate have been shown to correlate with pilot workload and can be measured using electrocardiograms (ECG). Traditional machine learning approaches rely on manually extracting features from ECG, which is a difficult and time-consuming process. Recent years witnessed the success of deep neural networks, especially deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in computer vision and related domains; however, the application of deep CNNs onto the ECG data faces challenges on both data insufficiency and lack of tailored CNN architectures. With a small training set, this work proposes the use of transfer learning with pre-trained deep CNNs for the prediction of pilot workload. Two ECG-derived visual representations, spectrograms and scalograms, are compared for their performance on the prediction. Experimental results indicate that the scalograms perform better (at 51.35%) than spectrograms (at 45.85%) in predicting three levels of pilot workload. With the scalograms, using the pre-trained deep CNNs as "off-the-shelf" feature extractors yields better performance than fine-tuning the deep CNNs (at 42.44%) for the ECG data. The deep features are visualized using dimension reduction with t-sne.},

Currently, there are a lot of machine learning methods which can be utilized for analyzing and classifying the ECG beats. However, the foremost shortcomings of these traditional machine learning solutions are use of a shallow structured classifier and hand-crafted suitable features. In this paper, we propose a nine-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) that can automatically extract appropriate features and detect the different categories of ECG beats based on individual records. Ten-fold cross-validation strategy is designed that boosts the robustness of our proposed CNN model. Our dataset consists of three types of ECG beats, namely: normal beat (N), premature ventricular contraction beat (V), and right bundle branch block beat (R). The experimental results demonstrate that with an appropriate choice of structure and parameters, our proposed deep learning model can classify the ECG hearts with a diagnose sensitivity of 98.37%, specificity of 99.19%, and accuracy of 98.92%.

Then, the beats are input into our multilead-CNN (ML-CNN), a novel model that includes sub two-dimensional (2-D) convolutional layers and lead asymmetric pooling (LAP) layers. As different leads represent various angles of the same heart, LAP can capture multiscale features of different leads, exploiting the individual characteristics of each lead. In addition, sub 2-D convolution can utilize the holistic characters of all the leads. It uses 1-D kernels shared among the different leads to generate local optimal features. These strategies make the ML-CNN suitable for multilead ECG processing. To evaluate our algorithm, actual ECG datasets from the PTB diagnostic database are used. The sensitivity of our algorithm is 95.40%, the specificity is 97.37%, and the accuracy is 96.00% in the experiments. Targeting lightweight mobile healthcare applications, real-time analyses are performed on both MATLAB and ARM Cortex-A9 platforms. The average processing times for each heartbeat are approximately 17.10 and 26.75 ms, respectively, which indicate that this method has good potential for mobile healthcare applications.},

abstract={Wireless body area network(WBAN) has become a promising type of networks to efficiently collecting as well as analyzing human physiological information. These collected data are then transformed to outside database support real-time monitoring or other health applications. However, due to the resource constrained of the networks, the monitored data needs to be analyzed for automatic detection of physiological changes indeed trigger an alarm of patient health degradation. Moreover, false alarm result by abnormal changes or faulty measurements should be classified to reduce unnecessary medical intervention.. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for data abnormal detection and classification on real-time ECG signals to distinguish faulty measurements form clinical emergency. Our work is based on adaptive 1-D convolutional neural networks(CNNs). We use small common ECG dataset to build a dedicated CNN models offline, which can be used to classify possibly long ECG data stream in a fast and accurate manner, such a solution can conveniently be used for real-time monitoring and early alert system in WBANs.The state-of-the-art performance on efficiency and accuracy for ECG classification over real dataset is achieved by the proposed method.},

In this paper, the ECG signals in the MIT - BIH standard library were used as sample data, which were identified and classified based on the algorithm of convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN)in order to realize the intelligent identification and classification of ECG signals. The R-wave peak location and heartbeat segmentation of the ECG signals were performed on the sample data using the differential threshold method, and a convolutional recurrent neural network was constructed to identify and classify the signals.

abstract={Capacitive ECG (cECG) can measure the cardiac electrical signal via capacitive coupling between electrodes and skin. This unconstrained measurement is suitable for personal heart monitoring; however, the instability in the quality of the signal hinders a further use of the signal. To use the cECG for heart monitoring, an adapted framework that could automatically classify the signal into clear cECG, arrhythmias and noise signal is a prerequisite. In view of this problem, the conventional quality estimation method using predefined features based on R-peak detection is not suitable for this unconstrained measurement of cECG. In this study, we examine the feasibility of arrhythmias detection from the cECG measurement using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The malignant ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) do not have the Q-R-S waveforms and therefore may be easily classified as the noise. Hence, in this study, we used the cECG signals that have 3 classes in quality (C1: clear signal; C2: blurry signal with significant R peak and N: noise) and the arrhythmias signals (VT, VF, and atrial fibrillation) from open databases to train the classification model. 13 subjects were recruited in an experiment for the cECG data collection in the Nara Institute of Science and Technology. As a result, the CNN model could recognize C1 and AF signal with over 0.98 recalls and precisions; whereas the recall and precision of VT and VF are lower scores and the lower scores were caused mainly by the similarity between VT and VF. Given the results of the CNN model, this CNN-based framework can accurately label the C1, AF, and malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT and VF) signals. Further stratification of the C2, VT, and VF will further enhance the use of the cECG measurement.},

abstract={Long-term Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has become a common means of diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. In order to reduce the workload of cardiologists and accelerate diagnosis, an automated patient-specific heartbeat classification method based on a customized convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed in this paper. The parallel convolutional layers with kernels of different receptive fields in the network are responsible for extracting multi-spatial deep features of the heartbeats, and the channel-wise attention module is adopted to selectively emphasize the informative features, which are beneficial to distinguish different classes of beats. To facilitate the extraction and emphasis of the important features, each heartbeat is segmented and stacked to form the multi-channel network input according to the basic temporal characteristics of the main components (P wave, QRS complex, and T wave) in the ECG. Besides, to further improve the network generalization and achieve better performance on various ECG of new patients, a method of intra-record sample clustering is proposed to select the representative heartbeats to construct the training set. The proposed method classifies heartbeats into five classes (normal beat (N), supraventricular ectopic beat (SVEB), ventricular ectopic beat (VEB), fusion beat (F), and unclassifiable beat (Q)). Validated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, our approach demonstrates performance superior to several state-of-the-art methods. In addition to an average accuracy and specificity of over 99%, this method achieves a sensitivity of 95.4% and a positive predictivity of 97.1% for VEB class, and a sensitivity of 81.1% and a positive predictivity of 90.0% for SVEB class. With high classification performance and pathological heartbeat detection accuracy, the proposed method is promising for clinical device applications.},

The ECG may manifest abnormal heart patterns, which are generally known as arrhythmias. MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and AAMI standards are used for machine learning purposes considering the patient-oriented scheme. Heartbeat time intervals and morphological features processed by a 2-D time-frequency wavelet transform of ECG signals are combined into an image, which carries relevant information from each heartbeat. These dataset images are used as input to train and evaluate the classifier, which is essentially a 6 layers convolutional neural network (CNN), resulting in powerful artifact discrimination. The training set is artificially augmented to reduce the imbalance of the five heartbeat classes, achieving better results. A significant achieved overall accuracy of 95.3% of the proposed method, compared to some of the most relevant published methods, permits to expect effective results when applied to real patients.},

abstract={Based on WHO's data in 2012, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is the most leading contributor to mortality, estimated at 17.5 million deaths. There are two effective way to examined heart condition, i.e. electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram. Although those two methods are effective, both methods are relatively expensive. The other method that can be used to examined heart condition is auscultation method. Auscultation requires substantial clinical experience. This process very subjective because it depends on the experience and the ability of paramedic hearing. Numerous research on developing an automatic system for detecting abnormal heart sound already conducted, but these studies still have some weaknesses making the accuracy in the classification less optimal. So, this paper aims to developed a scheme to classify the heart condition based on spectrogram of heartbeat sounds. To help increase the accuracy of the diagnosis, through this study, a CAD-based scheme was developed by applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm. The achieved classification accuracy is 82.75%. This indicates that the proposed method has a potential to be implemented in the development of a computer aided diagnosis for CVD.},

The aim of this project is to explore various deep learning models with data collected from our developed wearable ECG patch: IREALCARE.

abstract={In this paper, a novel electrocardiogram (ECG) signal classification and patient screening method is developed. The focus is on identifying patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) which is a life threatening cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed approach uses the raw ECG signal as the input and automatically learns the representative features for PAF to be used by a classification mechanism. The features are learned directly from the time domain ECG signals by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with one fully connected layer. The learned features can replace the hand-crafted features and our experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the learned features in patient screening. The experimental results indicate that combining the learned features with other classifiers will improve the performance of the patient screening system as compared to an End-to-End convolutional neural network classifier. The major characteristics of the proposed approach are to simplify the process of feature extraction for different cardiac arrhythmias and to remove the need for using a human expert to specify the appropriate features. The effectiveness of the proposed ECG classification method is demonstrated through performing extensive simulation studies.},

abstract={Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common chronic arrhythmia. Effective detection of the AF would avoid serious consequences like stroke. Conventional AF detection methods need heuristic or hand-crafted features extraction. Recently, deep learning (DL) techniques with massive data have been used on image, voice and other field widely with impressive results. The ECG rhythms such as AF, normal, Noisy and other rhythms have been segmented into 3 segments per rhythm, converted into 2D images using short time Fourier transform (STFT) and fed into pre-trained models. The pre-trained CNN models are used for transfer learning or are fine tuned for the detection and classification of the AF rhythm. The features extracted from the last layer of the pre-trained models are used as input to classical classification algorithms such as Ensemble classifier and support vector machine (SVM) for AF detection. The proposed approach would be have great potential on real-time monitoring of atrial fibrillation signal in electrocardiogram.

abstract={Correct heartbeat classification from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is fundamental to the diagnosis of arrhythmia. The recent advancement in deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has renewed the interest in applying deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of heartbeat classification. So far, the results are not very exciting. Most of the existing methods are based on ECG morphological information, which makes deep learning difficult to extract discriminative features for classification. Towards an opposite direction of feature extraction or selection, this paper proceeds along a recent proposed direction named feature enrichment (FE). To exploit the advantage of deep learning, we develop a FE-CNN classifier by enriching the ECG signals into time-frequency images by discrete short-time Fourier transform and then using the images as the input to CNN. Experiments on MIT-BIH arrhythmia database show FE-CNN obtains sensitivity (Sen) of 75.6%, positive predictive rate (Ppr) of 90.1%, and F1 score of 0.82 for the detection of supraventricular ectopic (S) beats. Sen, Ppr, and F1 score are 92.8%, 94.5%, and 0.94, respectively, for ventricular ectopic (V) beat detection. The result demonstrates our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms including other CNN based methods, without any hand-crafted features, especially F1 score for S beat detection from 0.75 to 0.82. This FE-CNN classifier is simple, effective, and easy to be applied to other types of vital signs.},

abstract={Atrial fibrillation, the most common sustained arrhythmia, is still a big challenge for researchers in the medical field. Many studies attempt to realize intelligent classification of AF based on deep learning methods. However, many of the studies focused on investigations of relatively simple datasets collected from a relatively small number of subjects. On the other hand, sophisticated preprocessing is usually adopted to analyse the ECG signals. These two factors significantly affect the generalization ability of the trained models for complicated data sets collected from a large number of subjects. In order to address this problem, an improved multi-scale decomposition enhanced residual convolutional neural network is proposed. The proposed method is applied to the large single-lead ECG dataset provided by the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017, and good classification accuracy is suggested by the testing results. In the proposed method, the original ECG record with a large difference in length is re-segmented into short samples of 9 s. Then, using the derived wavelet frame decomposition, the segmented short samples are decomposed and reconstituted into sub-signal samples of different scales. We trained the fast down-sampling residual convolutional neural networks (FDResNets) with the original short-signal dataset and the reconstructed dataset of each scale. The transfer learning technique is then applied to couple the three FDResNets with good performance into a multi-scale decomposition enhanced residual convolutional neural network (MSResNet). The FDResNet trained by the [0, 9.375 Hz] reconstruction dataset achieved the best performance. After six-fold cross-validation, the average test accuracy reached 87.12%, and the average comprehensive F1 score reached 85.29%. The average test accuracy of the multi-scale residual neural network reached 92.1%, and the average overall F1 score reached 89.9%.},
