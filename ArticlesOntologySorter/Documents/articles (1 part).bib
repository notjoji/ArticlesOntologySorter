abstract={In this study, the visualization experiments and transient numerical simulations of multiphase flow inside a rotodynamic pump are proposed by considering the interphase forces and bubble sizes to better understand the energy loss mechanisms during flow pattern transitions. To investigate the bubble diameter effect on the pump multiphase performance, Barrios (2007) prediction model accounting for intake parameters, e.g. inlet gas volumetric fraction (IGVF), pump rotational speed (n) etc., was employed. The comparison of numerical results against corresponding experimental data confirms the reliability of the proposed entropy production diagnostic model. Further simulation results reveal that typical components of each entropy production item are distinct in different flow patterns, such as gas pocket flow and segregated flow. Meanwhile, due to the local entropy production, the drastic change of harmonic component frequencies in pressure fluctuation spectrum is observed, which can be used as the key characteristics to distinguish different flow patterns. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Smart manufacturing is one of the key parts of the fourth industry revolution (Industry 4.0). It offers promising perspectives for high reliability, availability, maintainability and safety production process, but also makes the systems more complex and challenging for health assessment. To deal with these challenges, one needs to develop a robust approach to monitor and assess the system health state. In this paper, a practical and effective method that can be applied for fault detection and diagnostics of a given system is developed. The proposed method relies on a pattern recognition technique based on the construction of a new health indicator. This health indicator, which can be applied to different types of sensor measurements, is fed to an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to detect the health states of the system and diagnose the causes. Furthermore, the performance and the robustness of the proposed method are highlighted by considering various case studies under numerous operating conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Analyzing ultrasound images of relatively small fetal structures is a difficult task. This difficulty particularly applies to diagnosing congenital defects of the fetus, including one of the most common defects, which is the cleft palate. To date, no methods have been developed for visualizing the fetal palate. Therefore, there is a need to improve the effectiveness of diagnostics in this area by developing appropriate image analysis and recognition methods using computer-based techniques. At the same time, relatively fast algorithms are being sought that can be a part of the software of an ultrasound device. The contribution of the paper consists in defining a new computer method satisfying all the requirements mentioned above. The method applies syntactic pattern recognition approach to the analysis of the image of the fetus's palate. It is based on extracting of a sequence of images on multiple binarization thresholds (in the preprocessing phase), defining picture primitives on the basis of the histogram analysis, and applying a parser for a GDPLL(k) string grammar (Generalized Dynamically Programmed LL(k) grammar) for classifying abnormalities (in the recognition phase). The implementation of the method is computationally efficient and it can be a helpful tool for supporting doctors in the diagnostic process (as it has been verified in practice). The computer recognition of fetal defects on basis of the analysis of the structure of the fetus's palate is a novel achievement. Such results have never been reported before. © 2020},

abstract={Objective: To compare the efficacy of the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) simple rules versus pattern recognition to differentiate between benign and malignant ovarian masses. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study conducted at Kasr El Aini Hospital, Cairo, between April 2016 and October 2018 of 396 women with ovarian masses measuring more than 5 cm who were candidates for surgery. All patients underwent two-dimensional transvaginal sonography: level 2 with IOTA simple rules followed by level 3 with pattern recognition. Patients subsequently underwent ovarian cystectomy or oophorectomy and the specimens were examined histopathologically. Accuracy was measured by comparing sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy. Results: IOTA simple rules specified 44/50 cases as malignant and 220/242 as benign (sensitivity and specificity of 88.0% and 90.9%, respectively). Pattern recognition identified 83/94 cases as malignant and 281/302 as benign (sensitivity and specificity of 88.3% and 92.7%, respectively). No statistically significant difference in accuracy was found between the two methods. Conclusion: IOTA simple rules are an effective tool for detecting ovarian malignancy when performed by nonexpert sonographers. When results are inconclusive, pattern recognition should be performed additionally by an expert sonographer.

abstract={Background Rare diseases (RD) result in a wide variety of clinical presentations, and this creates a significant diagnostic challenge for health care professionals. We hypothesized that there exist a set of consistent and shared phenomena among all individuals affected by (different) RD during the time before diagnosis is established. Objective We aimed to identify commonalities between different RD and developed a machine learning diagnostic support tool for RD. Methods 20 interviews with affected individuals with different RD, focusing on the time period before their diagnosis, were performed and qualitatively analyzed. Out of these pre-diagnostic experiences, we distilled key phenomena and created a questionnaire which was then distributed among individuals with the established diagnosis of i.) RD, ii.) other common non-rare diseases (NRO) iii.) common chronic diseases (CD), iv.), or psychosomatic/somatoform disorders (PSY). Finally, four combined single machine learning methods and a fusion algorithm were used to distinguish the different answer patterns of the questionnaires. Results The questionnaire contained 53 questions. A total sum of 1763 questionnaires (758 RD, 149 CD, 48 PSY, 200 NRO, 34 healthy individuals and 574 not evaluable questionnaires) were collected. Based on 3 independent data sets the 10-fold stratified cross-validation method for the answer-pattern recognition resulted in sensitivity values of 88.9% to detect the answer pattern of a RD, 86.6% for NRO, 87.7% for CD and 84.2% for PSY. Conclusion Despite the great diversity in presentation and pathogenesis of each RD, patients with RD share surprisingly similar pre-diagnosis experiences. Our questionnaire and data-mining based approach successfully detected unique patterns in groups of individuals affected by a broad range of different rare diseases. Therefore, these results indicate distinct patterns that may be used for diagnostic support in RD. © 2019 Grigull et al.

abstract={Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is becoming a growing threat for all pregnancies. In this study, we set up an automatic screening method combining both transcriptomic databases and support vector machine (SVM)-based pattern recognition to select biomarkers that can be used in predicting and preventing GDM for gravidas. We screened 63 samples (32 GDM samples and 31 normal controls) in GEO database for the GDM-specific biomarkers. Differentially expressed genes between patients with GDM and normal controls were picked out using edgeR package. Enrichment analysis was performed using database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery. The regulatory gene network was constructed based on the KEGG pathway database. Genes in the hub of the network were selected as specific biomarkers of GDM and further validated through document investigation. Finally, the GDM prediction model was verified using the SVMs. In total, 189 probes corresponding to 69 genes that differentially expressed between GDM and controls were screened out by edgeR package. Nineteen pathways were clustered by KEGG enrichment analysis and were integrated into a regulatory network containing 572 nodes and 1874 edges. The intersection of 50 hub genes extracted from the network and 69 differential genes picked out by edgeR was a collection of six genes, including members of HLA superfamily. In the SVM model, the six genes had a good capacity of predicting GDM in both the training data set (area under curve [AUC] is 0.781) and the testing data set (AUC is 0.710) and had been reported to be associated with GDM. We found that the collection of six genes can be potentially applied as a biomarker for GDM diagnosis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Recent advancements in healthcare devices and the availability of numerous medical data have facilitated the management of chronic diseases. In addition, machine learning tools have made the management and diagnostic of a chronic illness more efficient by converting collected medical data from biosensors into meaningful clinical information. However, securing sensitive medical data, collected from patients, is still a challenging task. Hardware-based neural networks address this data safety concern by on-chip processing of acquired data, without cloud communications. Therefore, the presented ANN model was designed to comply with the intrinsic structure of neuromorphic platforms for future integrations. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={Technologies applied for the recognition of facial features in diagnosing certain disorders seem to be promising in reducing the medical burden and improve the efficiency. This pilot study aimed to develop a computer-assisted tool for the pattern recognition of facial features for diagnosing Turner syndrome (TS). Photographs of 54 patients with TS and 158 female controls were collected from July 2016 to May 2017. Finally, photographs of 32 patients with TS and 96 age-matched controls were included in the study that were further divided equally into training and testing groups. The process of automatic classification consisted of image preprocessing, facial feature extraction, feature reduction and fusion, automatic classification, and result presentation. A total of 27 physicians and 21 medical students completed a web-based test including the same photographs used in computer testing. After training, the automatic facial classification system for diagnosing TS achieved a 68.8% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity (and a 67.6% average sensitivity and 87.9% average specificity after resampling), which was significantly higher than the average sensitivity (57.4%, P < 0.001) and specificity (75.4%, P < 0.001) of 48 participants, respectively. The accuracy of this system was satisfactory and better than the diagnosis by clinicians. However, the system necessitates further improvement for achieving a high diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Objective: Distal myopathies are a diagnostically challenging group of diseases. We wanted to understand the value of MRI in the current clinical setting and explore the potential for optimizing its clinical application. Methods: We retrospectively audited the diagnostic workup in a distal myopathy patient cohort, reassessing the diagnosis, whilst documenting the usage of MRI. We established a literature based distal myopathies MRI pattern template and assessed its diagnostic utility in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and potential impact on the diagnostic workup. Results: Fifty-five patients were included; in 38 with a comprehensive set of data the diagnostic work-up was audited. The median time from symptoms onset to diagnosis was 12.1 years. The initial genetic diagnostic rate was 39%; 18% were misdiagnosed as neuropathies and 13% as inclusion body myositis (IBM). Based on 21 publications we established a MRI pattern template. Its overall sensitivity (50%) and specificity (32%) were low. However in some diseases (e.g., MYOT-related myopathy, TTN-HMERF) MRI correctly identified the causative gene. The number of genes suggested by MRI pattern analysis was smaller compared to clinical work up (median 1 vs. 9, p < 0.0001) but fewer genes were correctly predicted (5/10 vs. 7/10). MRI analysis ruled out IBM in all cases. Conclusion: In the diagnostic work-up of distal myopathies, MRI is useful in assisting genetic testing and avoiding misdiagnosis (IBM). The overall low sensitivity and specificity limits its generalized use when traditional single gene test methods are applied. However, in the context of next generation sequencing MRI may represent a valuable tool for interpreting complex genetic results. © 2018 Bugiardini, Morrow, Shah, Wood, Lynch, Pitmann, Reilly, Houlden, Matthews, Parton, Hanna, Straub and Yousry.},

High well counts amplify the need for timely relevant solutions. This study presents a supervised machine learning (ML) technique, support vector machine (SVM), to automatically identify Chan diagnostic patterns for timely detection and control of excess water production. The project involved publicly available production data. First, we performed manual identification of different Chan plot patterns and split the data set for training, cross-validation, and testing. Next, we normalized each subset, balanced the number of samples per pattern, trained the SVM model, and evaluated its ability on the test data set. The final stage involved model parameter tuning to explore opportunities to improve the model accuracy. When collecting representative samples, we observed uneven sample counts for pattern type subsets. Balancing the training data set was necessary to ensure that the model could generalize well for previously unseen production data. To ensure a relevant comparison among wells within each pattern type, we performed time- and WOR-based normalization. We confirmed that the SVM model was highly accurate across diverse fields and hence did not exhibit a locality bias. Operator companies can harness the prior classification of water control trends by experienced engineers. As more wells start exhibiting specific pattern signatures, the algorithm helps to proactively identify them. The approach maximizes the effectiveness of water production analysis and helps to reinforce technical quality and continuity among engineering personnel. The study demonstrated an application of SVM to the classification task of identifying water control diagnostic plot signatures across different fields. We proposed stricter visual definitions of signature types. Patterns such as normal displacement and multilayer channeling are extremely similar; therefore, we presented feature engineering required to increase classification accuracy in similar edge cases. With various kernels, the described SVM methodology can help production engineers to proactively perform surveillance activities that require identifying signature patterns in Chan plots.

abstract={Aim: To examine diagnostic and prognostic potential of quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) analyzed by the statistical pattern recognition (SPR) method in patients with cognitive impairment. We compared the differential diagnostic ability of SPR to visual EEG analysis. Correlation between SPR findings and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers were evaluated. Methods: It is a multicenter cohort study involving 129 patients, (mild cognitive impairment [MCI], AD, and healthy controls). Standardized EEG was performed at baseline. Patients were continuously clinically evaluated. Results: Receiver Operating Characteristic curves showed a low discriminative ability of SPR and no ability to predict clinical progression in patients with MCI. Moderate correlation between SPR analysis and CSF AD biomarkers was found. Conclusion: The diagnostic and prognostic abilities of qEEG were low. The SPR method was superior to the visual EEG analysis. The qEEG method correlates well to CSF AD biomarkers, suggesting association with pathology in AD. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by S.

abstract={Gastric cancer is a completely curable cancer when it can be detected at its early stage. Thus, because early detection of gastric cancer is important, cancer screening by gastroscopy is performed. Recently, the hyperspectral camera (HSC), which can observe gastric cancer at a variety of wavelengths, has received attention as a gastroscope. HSC permits the discerning of the slight color variations of gastric cancer, and we considered its applicability to a gastric cancer diagnostic support system. In this paper, after correcting reflectance to absorb the individual variations in the reflectance of the HSC, a gastric cancer diagnostic support system was designed using the corrected reflectance. In system design, the problems of selecting the optimum wavelength and optimizing the cutoff value of a classifier are solved as a pattern recognition problem by the use of training samples alone. Using the hold-out method with 104 cases of gastric cancer as samples, design and evaluation of the system were independently repeated 30 times. After analyzing the performance in 30 trials, the mean sensitivity was 72.2% and the mean specificity was 98.8%. The results showed that the proposed system was effective in supporting gastric cancer screening. © 2016 Hiroyuki Ogihara et al.},

abstract={Psychiatric disorders are increasingly being recognised as having a biological basis, but their diagnosis is made exclusively behaviourally. A promising approach for 'biomarker' discovery has been based on pattern recognition methods applied to neuroimaging data, which could yield clinical utility in future. In this review we survey the literature on pattern recognition for making diagnostic predictions in psychiatric disorders, and evaluate progress made in translating such findings towards clinical application. We evaluate studies on many criteria, including data modalities used, the types of features extracted and algorithm applied. We identify problems common to many studies, such as a relatively small sample size and a primary focus on estimating generalisability within a single study. Furthermore, we highlight challenges that are not widely acknowledged in the field including the importance of accommodating disease prevalence, the necessity of more extensive validation using large carefully acquired samples, the need for methodological innovations to improve accuracy and to discriminate between multiple disorders simultaneously. Finally, we identify specific clinical contexts in which pattern recognition can add value in the short to medium term. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Background Clinical symptoms in children with pulmonary diseases are frequently non-specific. Rare diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), cystic fibrosis (CF) or protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) can be easily missed at the general practitioner (GP). Objective To develop and test a questionnaire-based and data mining-supported tool providing diagnostic support for selected pulmonary diseases. Methods First, interviews with parents of affected children were conducted and analysed. These parental observations during the pre-diagnostic time formed the basis for a new questionnaire addressing the parents' view on the disease. Secondly, parents with a sick child (e.g. PCD, PBB) answered the questionnaire and a data base was set up. Finally, a computer program consisting of eight different classifiers (support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy rule-based, random forest, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, naive Bayes and nearest neighbour) and an ensemble classifier was developed and trained to categorise any given new questionnaire and suggest a diagnosis. For estimating the diagnostic accuracy, we applied ten-fold stratified cross validation. Results All questionnaires of patients suffering from CF, asthma (AS), PCD, acute bronchitis (AB) and the healthy control group were correctly diagnosed by the fusion algorithm. For the pneumonia (PM) group 19/21 (90.5%) and for the PBB group 17/18 (94.4%) correct diagnoses could be reached. The program detected the correct diagnoses with an overall sensitivity of 98.8%. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses confirmed the accuracy of this diagnostic tool. Case studies highlighted the applicability of the tool in the daily work of a GP. © 2015 Rother et al.},

abstract={Statistical Process Control (SPC) methods for detecting process mean shifts have high computational cost and they are not effective in detecting trends. We propose a new methodology to recognize abnormal patterns of Multivariate processes efficiently using Control Charts Pattern Recognition (CCPR), which is an important tool for production systems monitoring. All previous studies in this field assume that one or more variables measured for the CCPR process are responsible for the abnormal pattern, however, we dismiss this assumption and consider different fault roots. Different classifiers are compared in terms of accuracy. The classification accuracy comparisons are made with different values of the MEWMA smoothing parameter for different process "complexity". In addition, the case of monitoring Multivariate processes without using MEWMA or T2 statistics are presented. The applied method stays accurate for more complicated process with many attributes monitored. We also present and compare two strategies for fault diagnostics after failure occurrence using data from a real world case study. The results shows the "bottom-up strategy" for fault detection slightly outperforms "top-down strategy".},

abstract={A significant challenge for making viable small modular reactors (SMRs) is the need to reduce demands for labor-intensive surveillance. In this paper, this challenge is addressed using pattern recognition techniques for on-line monitoring and fault-detection. Known sensor faults are introduced into a model and logistic regression models are trained for classifying these sensor faults. The fault modes include three types of noise: saturation, sensor bias, and impulsive. These trained classifiers are thereafter implemented in real time for demonstrating the effectiveness of this on-line sensor fault pattern recognition technique. This method falls into the heteroassociative inference class of models common to the nuclear industry, however, this pattern recognition engine is inferring the class of particular faults and not particular process variable parameters. Knowledge of sensor fault types can be useful for operator decision processes as sensor faults influence both automatic and operator-driven actuation decisions.},

abstract={Glaucoma is one of the major causes for blindness with a high rate of unreported cases. To reduce this number, screening programs are performed. However, these are characterized by a high workload for manual and cost-intensive assessment. Computer-aided diagnostics (CAD) to perform an automated pre-exclusion of normals might help to improve program's efficiency. This chapter reviews and discusses recent advances in the development of pattern recognition algorithms for automated glaucoma detection based on structural retinal image data. Two main methodologies for glaucoma detection are introduced: (i) structure-driven approaches that mainly rely on the automated extraction of specific medically relevant indicators and (ii) data-driven techniques that perform a generic machine learning approach on entire image data blobs. Both approaches show a reasonable and comparable performance although they rely on different basic assumptions. A combination of these might further improve CAD for a more efficient and cost-sensitive workflow as a major proportion of normals will be excluded from unnecessary detailed investigations. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

abstract={ECG (Electrocardiogram) is a reliable and efficient test for monitoring the activities inside the cardiovascular system. The ECG reports are used to measure the electrical activities of the heartbeat which can be useful for many important conclusions regarding the heart diseases. In the recent past, there has been a lot of attention for the classification of these heartbeats using the ECG reports. In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are serving a lot in the area of automation in the medical and health-care domain. Deep Learning techniques are really growing day-by-day and Neural Networks are one of the major advancements in it. Neural Networks are really efficient in the problems like classification and segmentation. This study proposes a Deep CNN based model for classification of heartbeat using the ECG reports in five different classes which correspond to the different types of arrhythmia that are according to the standards of AAMI-EC57. We have evaluated our model on the Physionet's MIT-BIH and PTB Diagnostics datasets. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Cardiovascular diseases, listed as the underlying cause of death, accounted for approximately 836,546 deaths in the United States in 2018. Statistics show that almost one of every three deaths in the US is a result of heart disease. Nearly 2,300 Americans die of cardiovascular disease each day, an average of one death every 38 seconds. This is while quick and immediate action at the onset of such heart conditions can save many lives. To this end, ample research has been reported in the literature on Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal analysis to determine arrhythmia and other cardiac conditions. However, more accurate and near real-time techniques are still under investigation. This work introduces a classifier that will detect abnormalities of the ECG signal with its analysis as a 2-D image fed to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier. The proposed method classifies the ECG signal as normal or abnormal by transforming the single-lead ECG signal into images and then applying CNN classification. Images are taken from the European ST-T dataset on PhysioNet databank. Our method yields an accuracy of 97.47%. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The occlusion in one of the coronary arteries of the heart leads to the cardiac ailment, myocardial infarction (MI). The localization of MI based on the investigation of the morphology of the multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the initial task for the diagnosis of this ailment. In this paper, the multiscale convolutional neural network is proposed for the automated localization of MI ailment from multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) beats. The Fourier-Bessel (FB) series expansion based empirical wavelet transform (EWT) with fixed order ranges is introduced for the multiscale analysis of multi-lead ECG beat. The FB spectrum of each lead ECG beat is segregated into contiguous segments using the fixed order ranges. Furthermore, the order ranges from these contiguous segments are used to design an empirical wavelet filter bank for the extraction of subband signals from each lead ECG beat. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for the classification of various categories of MI as anterior MI (AMI), anterio-lateral MI (ALMI), anterio-septal MI (ASMI), inferior MI (IMI), inferio-lateral MI (ILMI), inferio-posterio-lateral MI (IPLMI) and normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The experimental results reveal that the lower-order range subband signal coupled with CNN attains higher average accuracy values of 99.92%, 99.34%, 99.95%, 99.95%, 99.91%, and 99.86% respectively, for AMI, ALMI, ASMI, IMI, ILMI, and IPLMI classes. The subband signal of multi-lead ECG beats with order range of [1-26] is highly affected during various categories of MI heart disease, and this band signal has higher performance as compared to the existing MI localization approaches. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The market of wearable healthcare monitoring devices has exploded in recent years as healthcare consciousness has increased. These types of devices usually consist of several biosensors, which can be worn on human bodies, such as the head, arms, and feet. The health status of a user can be analyzed according to the user's real-time vital signs that are collected from different biosensors. Due to personal medical data being transmitted through a wireless network, the data have to be encrypted. In this paper, a key agreement protocol for biosensors within Wireless Body Sensor Networks (WBSN) has been proposed based on the n-Party Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. In order to prevent the man-in-the-middle attacks, we have used Advance Encryption Standard (AES) encryption with Electrocardiography-based (ECG-based) keys to secure the key exchange procedures. The security and performance analysis show the feasibility of the proposed method.},

abstract={Body Sensor Network (BSN) -- a network of body-worn wireless health monitoring sensors -- have a tremendous potential to remove the space and time restrictions on health management. Given the importance of the data BSNs collect for improved health outcomes, securing the data from unauthorized tampering is essential. A compromised (or externally influenced) sensor in a BSN may generate erroneous patient data leading to, among other things, wrong diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, we present a novel approach to address the problem of detecting maliciously induced morphological alterations in the ECG signal (i.e., inducing changes to its shape). Our approach works by correlating the ECG signals with synchronously measured arterial blood pressure (ABP) signal measured using a distinct (and un-compromised) sensor. Initial analysis of our system demonstrates promising results, with 99.75% accuracy in detecting ECG signal morphological alterations for healthy patients with normal sinus rhythms.},

This paper investigates the use of electrocardiogram (ECG) as an authentication factor in VANETs and shared car context. Other authentication approaches exist, but many of them do not apply continuous authentication, resulting in scenarios where illegitimate drivers can use the vehicle as it is unlocked and on. ECG has historically been employed for healthcare monitoring and, only recently, as a biometric based on the QRS graphical deflections. We exploit the ECG biometric aspect and we employ a fiducial point detection algorithm based on Hill Climbing to detect the QRS complex. Our approach is feasible given the small time window required for data collection and the simple QRS detection process, which can be implemented in any device, different from other complex proposals.},

abstract={The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a physiological signal highly sensitive to disturbances during its acquisition. To palliate this issue, many works have described preprocessing algorithms operating in 12-lead, short-term ECG recordings. However, only a few methods have been introduced to detect noisy segments in single-lead, long-term ECG signals, this being a pending challenge to be resolved. Hence, this work proposes a novel technique to automatically detect low-quality segments in single-lead, long-term ECG recordings. The method is based on the high learning capability of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which has been trained with 2D images obtained when turning ECG recordings into scalograms using a continuous Wavelet transform (CWT). To validate the method, a publicly available dataset containing single-lead, long-term ECG intervals from patients with different cardiac rhythms has been used. These signals have been annotated by experts, who identified noisy intervals and those with sufficient quality to be clinically interpreted. The results have shown that the proposed method discriminates correctly between low and high-quality ECG segments with an accuracy greater than 90%, and with sensitivity slightly larger than specificity.},

Heartbeats are classified as normal (N), premature ventricular contractions (PVC), right bundle branch block (RBBB) rhythm by using ECG signals obtained from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The first approach is to directly use ECG time-series signals as input to CNN, and in the second approach ECG signals are converted into time-frequency domain matrices and sent to CNN. The most appropriate parameters such as number of the layers, size and number of the filters are optimized heuristically for fast and efficient operation of the CNN algorithm. The proposed system demonstrated high classification rate for the time-series data and spectrograms by using deep learning algorithms without standard feature extraction methods. Performance evaluation is based on the average sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values. It is also worth to note that spectrogram increases the performance of classification since it extracts the useful time-frequency information of the signal.},

abstract={Currently, many researches focus on the classification of heart beats. It is rare to study the classification of the entire ECG records. In fact, these two issues are completely different, record level classification is more difficult than beat level classification. In this paper, we propose a record level ECG classification method by combining 1-D deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM). The proposed method utilizes CNN to automatic extract features of ECG patches without complex data pre-processing or artificial feature scheme, and then utilizes two layers LSTM to model the underlying temporal correlation relation among ECG patches. In order to alleviate vanishing gradient problem and enhance representation power of features, we combine residual connection and attention mechanisms to build a residual attention module. Stacked residual attention modules not only deepen the network, but also refine the feature maps from both spatial and channel dimensions. We validate the proposed method through the dataset provide by The China Physiological Signal Challenge 2018 (6,877 ECG records, 9 classes), the cross-validation result of F1 score is 0.78.

abstract={We propose a novel electrocardiogram (ECG) beat classification algorithm using a combination of Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BiRNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named as BiRCNN. Our model is an end-to-end model. The morphological features of each ECG beat is extracted by CNN. Then the features of each beat are considered in the context via BiRNN. The assessment on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MITDB) resulted in a sensitivity of 98.7% and a positive predictivity of 96.4% on average for the VEB class. For the SVEB class, the sensitivity was 92.8%, which was an over 6% promotion compared with the state-of-the-art method, and the positive predictivity was 81.9% on average. The results demonstrate the superior classification performance of our method.},

abstract={Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a biomedical signal which represents the electrical activity of the human heart. Various cardiac diseases have been detected using the outputs of ECG devices. Recently, advances in signal processing techniques bring out a new horizon for processing the ECG signals. In this scope, a novel application based on the spectrogram, which is a graphical representation of time-frequency information of the signal, and the convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed so as to distinguish ECG signals. To this aim, a publicly available data set in Physionet was utilized. Firstly, the spectrograms of each signal were obtained. Then, these colorful spectrogram images were applied as the input to CNNs that are AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-18. The transfer learning and fine-tuning approach were used for training and validation of the models. As a result, the most efficient results were provided by AlexNet with an accuracy of 83.82%. The experimental results of this study show that the proposed model ensures promising results for the ECG signal classification.},

abstract={Progress in wearable techniques makes the long-term daily electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring possible. Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias. This study proposed a method by combining the modified frequency slice wavelet transform (MFSWT) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Training data are from the 2018 China physiological signal challenge (934 PVC and 906 non-PVC recordings). The first 10-s ECG waveforms in each recording were transformed into 2-D time-frequency images (frequency range of 0-50 Hz and size of 300 × 100) using MFSWT. A 25-layer CNN structure was constructed, which includes five convolution layers with kernel size of 3×3, five dropout layers, five ReLU layers, five maximum pooling layers with kernel size of 2 × 2, a flatten layer, two fully connected layers, as well as the input and output layers. Test data were recorded from 12-lead Smart ECG vests, including 775 PVC and 742 non-PVC recordings. Results showed that, the proposed method achieved a high accuracy of 97.89% for PVC/non-PVC episodes classification, indicating that the combination of MFSWT and CNN provides new insight to accurately identify PVC from the wearable ECG recordings.},

abstract={This paper explores the impact of bathtub water temperature on personal identification with ECG signal using convolutional neural network. Ten volunteers' ECG records are collected with lead-III at low temperature of bathtub water (38±0.2 ° C in average) and high temperature of bathtub water (42±0.5 °C in average) environments, respectively. Each record is about 5±1 minutes at low temperature and 4±1 minutes at high temperature. In the data preprocessing stage, we denoise the original ECG signal and segment the QRS complex on a beat-by-beat basis. Then, we perform two interpolation calculations based on the QRS segmentation and convert the QRS complex into a binary image one by one. When we use the ECG signals which are collected at low temperature to train and test the CNN model, the identification rate is 82.67%. However, if we use the ECG signal collected at high temperature to test this trained CNN model, the identification rate is only 13.33%. Conversely, when we use the ECG signal collected at high temperature to train and test the CNN model, the identification rate is 85.50%. However, if we use the ECG signal collected at low temperature to test this trained CNN model, the identification rate is only 12.17%. Thus, we notice that the different bathtub water temperature has an important impact on the ECG signal patterns and it is feasible to perform personal identification by convolutional neural network with ECG signal collected during bathing at the same temperature.},

abstract={Goal: This paper presents a fast and accurate patient-specific electrocardiogram (ECG) classification and monitoring system. Methods: An adaptive implementation of 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is inherently used to fuse the two major blocks of the ECG classification into a single learning body: feature extraction and classification. Therefore, for each patient, an individual and simple CNN will be trained by using relatively small common and patient-specific training data, and thus, such patient-specific feature extraction ability can further improve the classification performance. Since this also negates the necessity to extract hand-crafted manual features, once a dedicated CNN is trained for a particular patient, it can solely be used to classify possibly long ECG data stream in a fast and accurate manner or alternatively, such a solution can conveniently be used for real-time ECG monitoring and early alert system on a light-weight wearable device. Results: The results over the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a superior classification performance than most of the state-of-the-art methods for the detection of ventricular ectopic beats and supraventricular ectopic beats. Conclusion: Besides the speed and computational efficiency achieved, once a dedicated CNN is trained for an individual patient, it can solely be used to classify his/her long ECG records such as Holter registers in a fast and accurate manner. Significance: Due to its simple and parameter invariant nature, the proposed system is highly generic, and, thus, applicable to any ECG dataset.},

abstract={Premature Ventricular Contraction refers to irregular heartbeat and is one common symptom to several heart diseases. Currently, physiological databases are not only large in volume but also complex in dimensional aspect, so that intelligent systems that can process multi-dimensional data to detect Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) are highly needed. In this paper, we propose novel models of combinations of multi-leads ECG from the 12 lead ECG St. Petersburg Arrhythmias database to detect PVCs and optimize the required data pre-processing resources for Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) implemented on wearable devices. Although exhibiting fewer performances than previous works, the proposed method is able to perform automatic features extraction, reduce the CNN complexity and is scalable to be applied to 3-Lead to 16-Lead ECG systems. The combination scenarios include Wavelet fusion method and Tucker-decomposition before CNN is deployed as a classifier. The achieved accuracy to detect PVC for tensor-based feature extraction, the most optimized processing technique, is 90.84% with a sensitivity of 78.60% and a specificity of 99.86%.},

abstract={Automatic classification of abnormal beats in ECG signals is crucial for monitoring cardiac conditions and the performance of the classification will improve the success rate of the treatment. However, under certain circumstances, traditional classifiers cannot be adapted well to the variation of ECG morphologies or variation of different patients due to fixed hand-crafted features selection. Additionally, existing deep learning related solutions reach their limitation because they fail to use the beat-to-beat information together with single-beat morphologies. This paper applies a novel solution which converts one-dimensional ECG signal into spectro-temporal images and use multiple dense convolutional neural network to capture both beat-to-beat and single-beat information for analysis. The results of simulation on the MIT-BIH arrhythmias database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology by showing an outstanding detection performance compared to other existing methods.},

abstract={The classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is very important for the automatic diagnosis of heart disease. Traditionally, it is divided into two steps, including the step of feature extraction and the step of pattern classification. Owing to recent advances in artificial intelligence, it has been demonstrated that deep neural network, which trained on a huge amount of data, can carry out the task of feature extraction directly from the data and recognize cardiac arrhythmias better than professional cardiologists. This paper proposes an ECG arrhythmia classification method using two-dimensional (2D) deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The time domain signals of ECG, belonging to five heart beat types including normal beat (NOR), left bundle branch block beat (LBB), right bundle branch block beat (RBB), premature ventricular contraction beat (PVC), and atrial premature contraction beat (APC), were first transformed into time-frequency spectrograms by short-time Fourier transform. Subsequently, the spectrograms of the five arrhythmia types were utilized as input to the 2D-CNN such that the ECG arrhythmia types were identified and classified finally. Using ECG recordings from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database as the training and testing data, the classification results show that the proposed 2D-CNN model can reach an averaged accuracy of 99.00%. On the other hand, in order to achieve optimal classification performances, the model parameter optimization was investigated. It was found when the learning rate is 0.001 and the batch size parameter is 2500, the classifier achieved the highest accuracy and the lowest loss. We also compared the proposed 2D-CNN model with a conventional one-dimensional CNN model. Comparison results show that the 1D-CNN classifier can achieve an averaged accuracy of 90.93%. Therefore, it is validated that the proposed CNN classifier using ECG spectrograms as input can achieve improved classification accuracy without additional manual pre-processing of the ECG signals.},

abstract={The diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation (AF) is a lengthy and expensive procedure that often requires visual inspection of ECG signals by experts. In order to improve patient management and reduce healthcare costs, automated detection of these pathologies is of utmost importance. In this study, we classify short segments of ECG into four classes (AF, normal, other rhythms or noise) as part of the Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017. We compare a state-of-the-art feature-based classifier with a convolutional neural network approach. Both methods were trained using the challenge data, supplemented with an additional database derived from Physionet. The feature-based classifier obtained an F1 score of 72.0% on the training set (5-fold cross-validation), and 79% on the hidden test set. Similarly, the convolutional neural network scored 72.1% on the augmented database and 83% on the test set. The latter method resulted on a final score of 79% at the competition. Developed routines and pre-trained models are freely available under a GNU GPLv3 license.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel computationally intelligent-based electrocardiogram (ECG) signal classification methodology using a deep learning (DL) machine is developed. The focus is on patient screening and identifying patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), which represents a life threatening cardiac arrhythmia. The proposed approach operates with a large volume of raw ECG time-series data as inputs to a deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). It autonomously learns representative and key features of the PAF to be used by a classification module. The features are therefore learned directly from the large time domain ECG signals by using a CNN with one fully connected layer. The learned features can effectively replace the traditional ad hoc and time-consuming user's hand-crafted features. Our experimental results verify and validate the effectiveness and capabilities of the learned features for PAF patient screening. The main advantages of our proposed approach are to simplify the feature extraction process corresponding to different cardiac arrhythmias and to remove the need for using a human expert to define appropriate and critical features working with a large time-series data set. The extensive simulations and case studies conducted indicate that combining the learned features with other classifiers will significantly improve the performance of the patient screening system as compared to an end-to-end CNN classifier. The effectiveness and capabilities of our proposed ECG DL classification machine is demonstrated and quantitative comparisons with several conventional machine learning classifiers are also provided.},

abstract={Progress in wearable techniques makes the long-term daily electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring possible. However, the long-term wearable ECGs can be significantly contaminated by various noises, which affect the detection and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The situation becomes more serious for wearable ECG screening, where the data are huge, and doctors have no way to visually check the signal quality episode-by-episode. Therefore, automatic and accurate noise rejection for the wearable big-data ECGs is craving. This paper addressed this issue and proposed a noise rejection method for wearable ECGs based on the combination of modified frequency slice wavelet transform (MFSWT) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Wearable ECGs were recorded using the newly developed 12-lead Lenovo smart ECG vest with a sample rate of 500 Hz and a resolution of 16 bit. One thousand 10-s ECG segments were picked up and were manually labeled into three quality types: clinically useful segments with good signal quality (type A), clinically useful segments with poor signal quality (type B), and clinically useless segments (pure noises, type C). Each of the 1,000 10-s ECG segments were transformed into a 2-D time-frequency (T-F) image using the MFSWT, with a pixel size of 200×50. Then, the 2-D grayscale images from MFSWT were fed into a 13-layer CNN model for training the classification models. Results from the standard 5-folder cross-validation showed that the proposed combination method of MFSWT and CNN achieved a highest classification accuracy of 86.3%, which was higher than the comparable methods from continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The combination of MFSWT and CNN also had a good calculation efficiency. This paper indicated that the combination of MFSWT and CNN is a potential method for automatic identification of noisy segments from wearable ECG recordings.},

abstract={Electrocardiogram (ECG) biometric technology is being widely studied for probable use in identification and authentication tasks. To solve the these two problems , we propose novel two-stage ECG biometric methods that are based on Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). A blind segmentation technique effectively avoids the localization defect for ECG fiducial characteristic points. The random ECG segmentations are decomposed by EEMD to obtain 2D Time-Frequency (TF) representation, which is used as the input to train the CNN model. CNN can adaptively capture the representative features for the identification and authentication task, which is free of human interference with no manual feature extraction. Support Vector Machine(SVM) and cosine similarity are used for classification identification and authentication matching of feature vectors, respectively. The proposed algorithm performances are tested on the European ST-T database (EDB). The Equal Error Rate (EER) and the Identificaion Rate(IR) of EDB are 3.85%, 99.1%, respectively. The result indicates the feasibility and practicability of our proposed methods for biometric tasks.},

abstract={Detection of fetal QRS complexes in a noninvasive fetal electrocardiogram (NI-FECG) signal is an important task to check fetal conditions and to prevent birth defects. However, the detection is not easy because the NI-FECG signal contains a maternal ECG signal that has greater amplitude than that of a fetal ECG signal. This paper proposes an algorithm to detect the fetal QRS complexes in the NI-FECG signal. The proposed algorithm is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and can reliably detect the fetal QRS complexes without separating the maternal ECG signal. To verify the algorithm, NI-FECG data (PhysioNet/computing in cardiology challenge 2013) were used. The proposed algorithm showed the average sensitivity of 89.06 % and positive predictive value of 92.77 %. The proposed algorithm can help to check fetal conditions and to prevent birth defects.},

abstract={A high performance electrocardiogram (ECG)-based arrhythmic beats classification system is presented in this paper. The classifier was designed based on convolutional neural network (CNN). Single channel ECG signal was segmented into heartbeats in accordance with the changing heartbeat rate. The beats were transformed into dual beat coupling matrix as 2-D inputs to the CNN classifier, which captured both beat morphology and beat-to-beat correlation in ECG. A systematic training beat selection procedure was also proposed which automatically include the most representative beats into the training set to improve classification performance. The classification system was evaluated for the detection of supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEB or S beats) and VEB using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Our proposed method has demonstrated superior performance than several state-of-the-art detectors. In particular, our proposed CNN system has improved sensitivity and positive predictive rate for S beats by more than 12.2% and 11.9%, respectively, over these top performing algorithms. Our proposed CNN classifier with an automatic training beats selection process has shown to outperform the previous methods. The classifier is also a personalized one by combining training set from a common pool and a subject-specific set of ECG data. Our proposed system provides a reliable and fully automatic tool for detection of arrhythmia heartbeat without the need for manual feature extraction or expert assistant. It can potentially be implemented on portable device for the long-term monitoring of cardiac arrhythmia.},

abstract={Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a vital role in the clinical diagnosis of heart diseases. An ECG record of the heart signal over time can be used to discover numerous arrhythmias. Our work is based on 15 different classes from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. But the MIT-BIH dataset is strongly imbalanced, which impairs the accuracy of deep learning models. We propose a novel data-augmentation technique using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to restore the balance of the dataset. Two deep learning approaches-an end-to-end approach and a two-stage hierarchical approach-based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to eliminate hand-engineering features by combining feature extraction, feature reduction, and classification into a single learning method. Results show that augmenting the original imbalanced dataset with generated heartbeats by using the proposed techniques more effectively improves the performance of ECG classification than using the same techniques trained only with the original dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the heartbeats using GANs outperforms other common data augmentation techniques. Our experiments with these techniques achieved overall accuracy above 98.0%, precision above 90.0%, specificity above 97.4%, and sensitivity above 97.7% after the dataset had been balanced using GANs, results that outperform several other ECG classification methods.},

The proposed MS-WCNN model incorporates the one dimensional CNN and the Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) to extract discriminative features from the ECG signal and its wavelet sub-bands simultaneously. The extracted features are then merged using a concatenation strategy. This improves greatly the features learning process of our model at different scales, providing better diagnosis performances. The MITBIH Arrhythmia database has been used to evaluate the performance of the developed model, considering five heartbeats classes: Non-ectopic beat, Supra ventricular ectopic beat, Ventricular ectopic beat, Fusion beat and Unknown beat. The obtained results show that the MS-WCNN method achieves higher or comparable performances with respect to the existing ECG classification algorithms, with an overall diagnosis accuracy of 99, 11%.},

This project includes the design of an ECG-based biometric system that uses machine learning and deep learning techniques. ECG contains detailed information about electrical operation of the heart and the nature of this activity is highly personalized and can be used as biometric for authentication purpose. ECG based biometric can be mainly used in IOT based health care systems where data is transferred on internet. Other biometric systems require extra hardware to be used in health care systems. As ECG of a patient is taken in the hospitals, the same can be used for identification without extra hardware. Interval features of ECG signal are extracted and given to machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Machine learning techniques like SVM and KNN are used and deep learning is based on CNN. The datasets with diverse ECG behaviors are considered including MITDB, FANTASIA, NSRDB and QT. These datasets are collected from healthy or near-healthy participants and some include heart diseases such as arrhythmia and atrial fibrillation.

abstract={Unobtrusive measurement technologies for vital signs, such as capacitively coupled electrocardiography (cECG), allow for health monitoring outside the clinical domain, for example in automotive applications. While cECG has the potential to deliver accurate information about the driver's heart, the signal quality is very volatile compared to standard ECG and can be corrupted easily by motion artifacts. In this work, we present a signal-level fusion algorithm based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to locate individual heartbeats in three-channel cECG signals. To design and optimize the network's structure, data from the PhysioNet / CinC challenge “Robust Detection of Heart Beats in Multimodal Data” was used as an independent source. To train and test the algorithm, we used cECG data from six subjects and three different driving scenarios (highway, city, and proving ground) that is freely available as part of our UnoViS-database. Data consisted of 31 recordings with a total duration of 13.4 hours. Leave-one-subject-out cross validation was performed to assess the algorithm's performance. We achieved a sensitivity of 88.0% and a positive predictive value of 95.2% compared to the reference ECG, with a root-mean-square R-Peak localization error of 20.81 ms. The developed algorithm is available for download via the UnoViS-Website.},

abstract={In this paper we present fully automatic interpatient electrocardiogram (ECG) signal classification method using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). ECG is simple and non-invasive way to measure the electric activity of the heart and it provides valuable information about the condition of the heart. It is widely utilized for detecting different abnormalities in heartbeat. Identifying and classification abnormalities is time-consuming, because it often requires analyzing each heartbeat of the ECG recording. Therefore, automatic classification of the arrhythmias using machine-learning technologies can bring various benefits. In this paper, we are focusing on inter-patient arrhythmia classification, where separate patient data is used in training and test phase. This method is more realistic in clinical environment, where trained model needs to operate with patients, whose ECG data was not available during the training phase. Our proposed method gives 92% sensitivity, 97% positive predictivity and 23% false positive rate for normal heartbeats. For supraventricular ectopic beat, our approach gives 62% sensitivity, 56% positive predictivity and 2% false positive rate. For ventricular ectopic beat, our method gives 89% sensitivity, 51% positive predictivity and 6% false positive rate. These results from our fully automatic feature learning approach are on par with solutions that require manual feature engineering.},

The proposed methodology achieves with ECG data inputs which is transfigured into ECG images by mapping single ECG beat as individual 96x96 image and these images passed to the CNN. It learn the key features of used Atrial Fibrillation (AFB) arrhythmia database which is used for classification. These autonomous features directly learn by the CNN model with having different layers from ECG signal. This method will remove the human error to specify the diagnostic feature while working with big data. The case study and results show evident and approve the capability of the learned features for atrial fibrillation and flutter. The CNN classifier is used for classification which gives good results.},

abstract={This paper shows a novel approach for detecting ventricular heartbeats using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN). The algorithm input is the raw ECG signal, i.e., no signal pre-processing nor feature extraction are involved. The output of the 1D-CNN is filtered using a combination of linear and nonlinear filters to produce the final output. The MIT-BIH arrhythmia database was used for both algorithm training/tuning and evaluation. The assessment methodology followed the interpatient paradigm, where the algorithm was trained and evaluated using independent subsets. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated for two tasks; QRS detection, and heartbeat classification. QRS detection resulted in a sensitivity of 99.0% and a positive predictivity of 96.5%. The performance assessment of the ventricular ectopic beat detection resulted in a sensitivity of 85.8% and a positive predictivity of 64.5%. Although there is still room for improvement, the results suggest that convolutional neural networks are a promising approach for building heartbeat classifiers.},

Because ECG is a continuous measure of an electrophysiological signal, it is difficult to mimic, but at the same time, its day-to-day variations impact its permanence. In this paper, we present a study of the permanence of ECG biometric using a Convolutional Neural Network based authentication system and a multi-session ECG dataset collected from 800 users. The authentication system achieved an equal error rate of 2% on ECG-ID database, improving the state-of-the-art. Using this system, we designed a series of rigorous experiments by varying the days elapsed between when enrollment and authentication are performed. The results show that, despite controlling for posture, equal error rate increases as days pass. Simply including more data to enrollment does improve the accuracy, but more recent data are significantly more advantageous.},

abstract={Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common sustained chronic cardiac arrhythmia in elderly population, associated with a high mortality and morbidity in stroke, heart failure, coronary artery disease, systemic thromboembolism, etc. The early detection of AF is necessary for averting the possibility of disability or mortality. However, AF detection remains problematic due to its episodic pattern. In this paper, a multiscaled fusion of deep convolutional neural network (MS-CNN) is proposed to screen out AF recordings from single lead short electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. The MS-CNN employs the architecture of two-stream convolutional networks with different filter sizes to capture features of different scales. The experimental results show that the proposed MS-CNN achieves 96.99% of classification accuracy on ECG recordings cropped/padded to 5 s. Especially, the best classification accuracy, 98.13%, is obtained on ECG recordings of 20 s. Compared with artificial neural network, shallow single-stream CNN, and VisualGeometry group network, the MS-CNN can achieve the better classification performance. Meanwhile, visualization of the learned features from the MS-CNN demonstrates its superiority in extracting linear separable ECG features without hand-craft feature engineering. The excellent AF screening performance of the MS-CNN can satisfy the most elders for daily monitoring with wearable devices.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel deep learning framework for the inter-patient electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeat classification. A symbolization approach especially designed for ECG is introduced, which can jointly represent the morphology and rhythm of the heartbeat and alleviate the influence of inter-patient variation through baseline correction. The symbolic representation of the heartbeat is used by a multi-perspective convolutional neural network (MPCNN) to learn features automatically and classify the heartbeat. We evaluate our method for the detection of the supraventricular ectopic beat (SVEB) and ventricular ectopic beat (VEB) on MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods based on manual features or deep learning models, our method shows superior performance: the overall accuracy of 96.4%, F1 scores for SVEB and VEB of 76.6% and 89.7%, respectively. The ablation study on our method validates the effectiveness of the proposed symbolization approach and joint representation architecture, which can help the deep learning model to learn more general features and improve the ability of generalization for unseen patients.

abstract={Objective: This paper proposes a novel method to localize origins of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) from 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) using convolutional neural network (CNN) and a realistic computer heart model. Methods: The proposed method consists of two CNNs (Segment CNN and Epi-Endo CNN) to classify among ventricular sources from 25 segments and from epicardium (Epi) or endocardium (Endo). The inputs are the full time courses and the first half of QRS complexes of 12-lead ECG, respectively. After registering the ventricle computer model with an individual patient's heart, the training datasets were generated by multiplying ventricular current dipoles derived from single pacing at various locations with patient-specific lead field. The origins of PVC are localized by calculating the weighted center of gravity of classification returned by the CNNs. A number of computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the proposed method under a variety of noise levels and heart registration errors. Furthermore, the proposed method was evaluated on 90 PVC beats from nine human patients with PVCs and compared against ablation outcome in the same patients. Results: The computer simulation evaluation returned relatively high accuracies for Segment CNN (~78%) and Epi-Endo CNN (~90%). Clinical testing in nine PVC patients resulted an averaged localization error of 11 mm. Conclusion: Our simulation and clinical evaluation results demonstrate the capability and merits of the proposed CNN-based method for localization of PVC. Significance: This paper suggests a new approach for cardiac source localization of origin of arrhythmias using only the 12-lead ECG by means of CNN, and may have important applications for future real-time monitoring and localizing origins of cardiac arrhythmias guiding ablation treatment.},

abstract={Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal represents the electrical activity of the heart and playing an increasingly important role for practitioners to diagnose heart diseases. Widely available ECG data and machine learning algorithms present an opportunity to improve the accuracy of automated arrhythmia diagnosis. However, a comprehensive evaluation of morphological arrhythmias for the ECG analysis across a wide variety of diagnostic classes is still a complex task. This paper presents a generic morphological arrhythmias classification method designed for robust and accurate detection of the ECG heartbeat. In this method, the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is employed for features vector description because of its extraordinary statistical feature extraction ability. In addition, the convolutional neural network (CNN) approach is utilized to automatically classification from the generated 3D multi-scale GLCM. Obtained results from the experiments demonstrate that the proposed method in this paper is quite suitable for morphological arrhythmias detection. These findings demonstrate that the GLCM description can efficiently extract the shape features vector for a broad range of distinct arrhythmias from the lead ECGs with high diagnostic performance. The experimental results of the recognition for morphological arrhythmias show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method and could be used to reduce the rate of the misdiagnosed computerized ECG interpretations.},

The performance of the method is evaluated on a dataset of 70 overnight ECG recordings, with 35 recordings used for training the model and 35 for testing.

Objective stress recognition has proven to be a complicated issue, due to the number of parameters involved. Thus, the investigation of reliable indices associated with the stress response is of utmost importance. Heart activity may provide useful information towards this goal. Traditional machine learning techniques have been used in the area of emotion recognition but they sometimes present specific limitations. The emergence of Deep Learning (DL) techniques permits the reveal underlying patterns in electrocardiography (ECG) which, otherwise, would not be easily observed. The proposed DL architecture utilizes a variety of kernels per module to compute complex feature maps and enables a multi-level modelling of the unique heart rate variability signature for stress state identification.

abstract={Aims: Electrocardiographic waveforms (ECG) are recognized as the most reliable method to detect abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation. This task is challenging when the signals are distorted by noise. This paper presents an automatic classification algorithm to classify short lead ECGs in terms of abnormality of heart rhythm (AF or alternative rhythms) and quality (noisy recordings). Methods: To meet this end, at first baseline wander removal and Butterworth filter for each signal are applied as a preprocessing stage. Due to the existence of noise in recordings, high quality beats are selected for any further analysis using cycle quality assessment. Then, three sets of features defined as correlation coefficient, fractal dimension and variance of R peaks are extracted to predict noisy recordings. Two separate approaches are employed to classify other three classes. The first approach is the feature based methodology and the second one is the applying deep neural networks. In the first approach, features from different domains are extracted. The method for AF detection utilizes and characterizes variability in RR-intervals which are extracted by applying classic Pan-Tompkins algorithm. To improve the accuracy of the AF-detection, atrial activity is analyzed by understanding whether the P-wave is present in signal. This is done by investigating the morphology of P-waves. Heart rate abnormality and the existence of premature beats in a signal are regarded as two characteristics to distinguish non-AF rhythms. The whole sets of features are fed into a neural network classifier. Another approach uses the segments with 600 samples as the input of a 1 dimensional convolutional neural network. The output obtained from both approaches are combined using a decision table and finally the recordings are classified into three classes. Results: The proposed method is evaluated using scoring function from 2017 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge and achieved an overall score of 80% and 71% on the training dataset and hidden test dataset, respectively.},

abstract={Cardiac auscultation (CA) is the auditory detection of heart sounds to diagnose abnormalities, a crucial skill that is both efficient and cost-effective in medical practice. However, due to increased prevalence and usage of expensive cardiac technologies, many new physicians and trainees have difficulty performing essential cardiac examinations on their patients, particularly diagnosing abnormalities through auscultation using a stethoscope. A virtual pathology stethoscope is a simulation-based solution that train students to perform cardiac examinations by listening to abnormal heart sounds in otherwise healthy standardized patients (SPs). This study reports the accuracy of an electrocardiogram (ECG)-based stethoscope tracking method for placing virtual symptoms in correct auscultation regions. A modified stethoscope head with two electrodes was used to pick up ECG signals at the four primary auscultation sites. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) is then modeled to classify the location of the stethoscope by taking advantage of subtle differences in the ECG signals. A 91% accuracy was obtained, showing promising performance gain over our previous methods. This finding would significantly extend the simulation capabilities of SPs by allowing trainees to perform realistic CA and hear CA in clinical environment.},

abstract={To achieve an accurate real-time analysis for the classification of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has been a critical problem. Hence we propose an automatic classification method of ECG signals based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM). The CNN layers are mainly responsible to extract local temporal features and the LSTM layer is mainly responsible to encode the whole temporal history. It can automatically classify the four ECG signals in MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the classification were 99.86%, 99.86% and 99.96% respectively. For 5289s long ECG beat signals, the above classification effect takes only 4.46s time. In addition, the model has the best classification effect for five types of ECG signals under the AAMI standard. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are 99.12%, 99.15% and 99.84%, the classification time is only 0.81s for 756s length ECG signals.},

abstract={As stress is related to many mental and physical health problems, monitoring stress and its management is getting increasingly important in modern societies. Because of the advantage of convolutional neural network (CNN) in automatic feature learning, this study is proposed to use CNN to achieve accurate and fast detection of acute cognitive stress from heart rate variability (HRV). The traditional mental arithmetic calculation was adopted as the stressor for a total of twenty participants, during which one-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was acquired. Six conventional HRV methods for inferring cognitive stress were extracted from the ECG signals, and their performance in identifying acute cognitive stress was compared with the proposed CNN-based method. The experimental results showed that with a super-short (10 s) time window, the detection error rate of CNN was 17.3%, which is significantly better than the performance of all six conventional HRV methods (> 7.2%, p <; 0.01). Further analysis showed that the improvement achieved by the proposed CNN methods mainly came from the decrease in false stress sample detection. This study demonstrated the possibility of super-short windows and the advantage of CNN on acute cognitive stress detection. Its outcome would benefit practical applications of real-time stress detection via HRV.},

abstract={QRS detection is a crucial step in analyzing the electrocardiogram (ECG). For ECG collected by wearable devices, a robust QRS detection algorithm that yields high accuracy in spite of abnormal QRS morphologies and severe noise is needed. In this paper, we propose a QRS detection method based on high-resolution wavelet packet decomposition (HR-WPD) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Firstly, we design the HR-WPD that decomposes the ECG into multiple signals with different frequency bands to provide detailed QRS features. Secondly, all the decomposed signals are forwarded to a CNN for comprehensive morphology analysis and QRS prediction. To further improve the robustness, a time-attention module acting on the input signals is added to the CNN. Finally, a variable threshold is imposed to locate the QRS. The proposed method is validated by using two noisy databases (i.e., Telehealth Database (TELEDB) and MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database (NSTDB)) and one database with multiple ECG morphologies (i.e., MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (ARRDB)). The experiment results show that the proposed method achieves a comparable or even better performance compared with state-of-art methods on the TELEDB (SE 98.99%, P+ 95.57%, ER 5.61%, F1 97.25%), NSTDB (SE 99.25%, P+ 96.31%, ER 4.55%, F1 97.76%) and ARRDB (SE 99.89%, P+ 99.90%, ER 0.21%, F1 99.89%), suggesting that it is highly applicable to the QRS detection for ECG collected by wearable devices.},

abstract={Accurate identification of cardiac pathological events is the most important part of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal assessment. Cardiologists manually analyze data to detect any abnormality in the cardiac signal. Various abnormalities can be found in the cardiac signal such as ventricular tachyarrhythmia, malignant ventricular ectopy, congestive heart failure, intracardiac atrial fibrillation and many others. Here, we propose a time-frequency (TF) and convolution neural network (CNN) based approach for identification and classification of abnormalities in ECG. The proposed methodology applies Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (PWVD) on non-stationary ECG signals to obtain high resolution images and defining the signal in both time and frequency domains. The images train the multi-layer Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for classification. On testing, signatures of five abnormalities have been detected in ECG signals with high accuracy of 98.9%. The technique will facilitate the doctors to accurately diagnose and classify disease symptoms of cardiac patients.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) method based on 2-D convolutional neural network (CNN) by using electrocardiosignal (ECG singles). CNN shows outstanding performance in the field of image recognition nowadays, in order to make better use of this advantage, we innovatively convert electrocardiosignal into 2-D grayscale instead of traditional ECG. While ensuring that the image contains a complete cardiac cycle, it also enables the network to fully learn both the characteristics of the electrocardiosignal period and characteristics between each electrocardiosignal period. Optimization of the proposed CNN classifier includes various deep learning techniques such as batch normalization, data augmentation, Xavier initialization, and dropout. As a result, our classifier achieved 99.90% average accuracy. To precisely validate our CNN classifier, 10-fold cross-validation was performed at the evaluation which involves every ECG recording as a test data. Our experimental results have successfully validated that the proposed CNN classifier with the transformed ECG images can achieve excellent identification accuracy.},

abstract={A proper definition of cardiac events such as end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) is important for quantitative measurements in echocardiography. While ED can be found using electrocardiography (ECG), ES is difficult to extract from ECG alone. Further, on hand-held devices ECG is not available or cumbersome. Several methods for automatic detection of cardiac events have been proposed in the recent years, such as using a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by 1D recurrent layers. This structure may be suboptimal, as tissue movement has a spatio-temporal nature which is ignored in the CNN. We propose using a 3D CNN to extract spatio-temporal features directly from the input video, which are fed to long short term memory (LSTM) layers. The joint network is trained to classify whether frames belong to either diastole or systole. ES and ED are then automatically detected as the switch between the two states. The 3D CNN + LSTM model performs favourably at detecting cardiac events on a dataset consisting of standard B-mode images of apical four-and two-chamber views from 500 patients. The mean absolute error between events in the apical four-chamber view is 1.63 and 1.71 frames from ED/ES reference respectively. Model inference is fast, using (30 ± 2) ms per 30 frame input sequence on a modern graphics processing unit.},

abstract={Remote Myocardial Infarction (RMI) monitoring uses electronic devices to detect the electrocardiogram changes and inform the doctor in emergency conditions, which is an effective solution to save the patient's life. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Channel Lightweight CNN (MCL-CNN), which combines electrocardiogram signals from four leads (v2, v3, v5 and aVL) to detect the Anterior MI (AMI). Its multi-channel design allows the convolution of each lead to be independent of each other, and allowing them to find the filter that best suits them. In addition, constructing a lightweight network using different convolutional combinations in the MCL-CNN model, which makes the network has certain advantages in computing runtime parameters and more suitable for mobile devices. Meanwhile, we use balanced cross entropy to solve the problem of dataset class imbalance. These strategies make the MCL-CNN suitable for multi-lead ECG processing. Experimental results using public ECG datasets obtained from the PTB diagnostic database demonstrate that MCL-CNN's accuracy is 96.65%.},

abstract={Arrhythmia are disturbances in the heart where the heart beats slower or faster. Some types of Arrhythmia can became a serious problem and life-threatening. Early detection of Arrhythmia is very crucial to patients. Tools that can be used to determine heart condition is Electrocardiogram (ECG). Deep learning methods can be used to classify types of Arrhythmia from ECG images. Convolutional Neural Network is one of deep learning methods that is often used to classify images. CNN-based model such as VGG, ResNet, and MobileNet has gotten success in images classification. Those models are using lots of convolution layer, so those models are easily run into over fitting problem if those are used in small dataset. CNN model in this research needs parameter adjustments to solve over fitting problem. Parameter that were being adjusted were learning rate, dropout rate, and the number of convolution layer. The testing results on CNN model showed that the best learning rate and dropout rate which produced the best model to classify Arrhythmia were 0.0001, and 0.0075 respectively. The number of convolution layers which obtained the best accuracy was 4. Classification using CNN model for Arrhythmia with learning rate, dropout rate, and number of convolution layers were 0.0001, 0.0075, and 4 respectively resulted in the best model with 94.2 % accuracy value.},

abstract={Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common chronic arrhythmia. Effective detection of the AF would avoid serious consequences like stroke.

Instant heart rate sequence is extracted from ECG signal, then an end-to-end MCNN detects AF with the instant heart rate sequence as input and detection result as output. The algorithm was tested on both public and private datasets. On the public dataset, with the sensitivity achieved being 0.9822, the corresponding specificity is 0.9811, and the overall accuracy is 0.9818. The area under an ROC curve is as high as 0.9962, compared to the AUC of the best conventional method is 0.9947.

abstract={1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently become the state-of-the-art technique for crucial signal processing applications such as patient-specific ECG classification, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection in power electronics circuitry and motor-fault detection. This is an expected outcome as there are numerous advantages of using an adaptive and compact 1D CNN instead of a conventional (2D) deep counterparts. First of all, compact 1D CNNs can be efficiently trained with a limited dataset of 1D signals while the 2D deep CNNs, besides requiring 1D to 2D data transformation, usually need datasets with massive size, e.g., in the "Big Data" scale in order to prevent the well-known "overfitting" problem. 1D CNNs can directly be applied to the raw signal (e.g., current, voltage, vibration, etc.) without requiring any pre- or post-processing such as feature extraction, selection, dimension reduction, denoising, etc. Furthermore, due to the simple and compact configuration of such adaptive 1D CNNs that perform only linear 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions), a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible. This paper reviews the major signal processing applications of compact 1D CNNs with a brief theoretical background. We will present their state-of-the-art performances and conclude with focusing on some major properties.},

abstract={Blood infection due to different circumstances could immediately develop to an extreme body reaction that leads to a serious life-threatening condition, called Sepsis. Currently, therapeutic protocols through timely antibiotic resuscitation strategies play an important role to fight against the adverse conditions and improve survival. Therefore, timing, and more specifically early diagnosis of the illness, is crucially important for an effective treatment. Studies have indicated that vital signals such as heart rate variability (HRV) could provide potential prognostic biological markers that can help with early detection of sepsis before it is clinically diagnosed through its actual symptoms. Therefore, this study employs neonatal and pediatric electrocardiogram (ECG) to extract 52 hourly sets of linear and non-linear features from the HRV, starting from 24 hours prior to the clinical diagnosis of sepsis in patients with positive blood cultures (n=14). Similar sets of features were also obtained from a non-sepsis control group to create an evaluation benchmark (n=14).In particular, this study initially demonstrates how the variations within the 24 hours values of specific HRV featuresets could effectively reveal prognostic information about the evolution of sepsis, prior to the actual clinical diagnosis. Moreover, this study demonstrates that differences in the values of a particular set of features at 22 hours before the actual clinical diagnosis/symptoms can be reliably used to train a convolutional neural network for automatic classification between the individuals in the sepsis and non-sepsis groups with 88.89±7.86% accuracy.Clinical relevance— Results suggest potential early diagnosis of sepsis through real-time automatic classification of HRV features as prognostic indicators in clinical ECG recordings.},

abstract={Human effects are complex phenomena, which are studied for pervasive healthcare and well-being. The legacy pen and paper-based affective state determination methods are limited in their scientific explanation of causes and effects. Therefore, due to advances in intelligence technology, researchers are trying to apply some advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods to realize individuals' affective states. To recognize, realize, and predict a human's affective state, domain experts have studied facial expressions, speeches, social posts, neuroimages, and physiological signals. However, with the advancement of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and wearable computing technology, on-body non-invasive medical sensor observations are an effective source for studying users' effects or emotions. Therefore, this paper proposes an IoMT-based emotion recognition system for affective state mining. Human psychophysiological observations are collected through electromyography (EMG), electro-dermal activity (EDA), and electrocardiogram (ECG) medical sensors and analyzed through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to determine the covert affective state. According to Russell's circumplex model of effects, the five basic emotional states, i.e., happy, relaxed, disgust, sad, and neutral, are considered for affective state mining. An experimental study is performed, and a benchmark dataset is used to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The higher classification accuracy of the primary affective states has justified the performance of the proposed method.},

abstract={Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is one of the arrhythmias that is common and serious in clinic. In this study, a novel method of AF classification with a convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed, and particularly two cardiac rhythm features of R-R intervals and F-wave frequency spectrum were combined into the CNN for a good applicability of mobile application. Over 23 patients' ten-hours of Electrocardiogram (ECG) records were collected from the MIT-BIH database, and each of which was segmented into 10s-data fragments to train the designed CNN and evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Specifically, a total of 83,461 fragments were collected, 49,952 fragments of which are the normal fragments (type-N) and the others are the AF fragments. As results, the obtained average accuracy of the proposed method combining the two proposed features is 97.3%, which is shown a relative higher accuracy comparing with either that of the detection with the feature of R-R intervals (95.7%) or that with the feature of F-wave frequency spectrum (93.9%). Additionally, the sensitivity and the specificity of the present method are both of a high level of 97.4% and 97.2%, respectively. In conclusion, the CNN based approach by combining the R-R interval series and the F-wave frequency spectrum would be effectively to improve the performance of AF detection. Moreover, the proposed classification of AF with 10s-data fragments also could be potentially useful for a wearable real-time monitoring application for a pre-hospital screening of AF.},

abstract={Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a kind of video-based heart rate (HR) estimation technique which has widely potential applications in health monitoring and human- computer interaction. However, the accuracy of conventional rPPG methods is easily disturbed by motion and illumination artifacts. Recently, some deep learning based rPPG methods have attracted many attentions due to its good performance and robustness to noise. This paper proposes a new rPPG scheme using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map the pulse accumulated image to corresponding true heart rate value, where the spatial-temporal input images are constructed with raw pulses from conventional rPPG methods. In order to check the feasibility and ideal performance of this method, synthetic rPPG pulses are built using real electrocardiograph (ECG) or blood volume pulse (BVP) signals through a modified Akima cubic Hermite interpolation. We test the proposed method in three cases, subject dependent, subject independent, and also a cross-dataset one. The experimental results show that our method performs well in heart rate value estimation with synthetic rPPG pulses even for the cross-dataset case (mean absolute error HRmae = 4.36 BPM, root mean square error HRrmse = 6.26 BPM, mean error rate percentage HRmer = 5.46%). This pilot study verifies the feasibility of the proposed method and provides a solid foundation for the follow-up research with real rPPG pulses.},

abstract={Driver distraction is one of the major causes of road accidents which can lead to severe physical injuries and deaths. Statistics indicate the need of a reliable driver distraction system, which can monitor the driver's distraction and alert the driver before there is a chance of disasters on the road continuously an ubiquitously. Therefore, early detection of driver distraction can help decrease the cost of roadway disasters. Physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) have been extensively used for driver state monitoring at the physiological level. More recently, galvanic skin response (GSR) analysis, which is a minimally intrusive technology, has been investigated to develop monitoring systems which alerts divers early. In this paper, we propose a novel detection system that characterizes the impact of secondary tasks of calling and texting on the driver based on the spectrogram and MEL Cepstrum representation of the GSR signals and convolutional neural networks (CNN) modeling. The proposed detection system decomposes the GSR signals in 2D time-frequency representation to decode spectro-temporal patterns. We further isolate the spectral envelope and then extract Mel frequency filter bank coefficients in time and frequency. Our proposed deep CNN structure is designed to automatically learn reliable discriminative visual patterns in the 2D spectrogram and Mel cepstrum space. Passing the layers of the CNN, the low level features transform to high level features representing the impact of the secondary tasks. The aforementioned process replaces the traditional ad hoc hand-crafted feature extraction when working with a high dimensional time-series dataset. The classification accuracy of the proposed prediction algorithm is evaluated based on a set of recorded GSR signals from 7 driver subjects during a naturalistic driving. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a high accuracy of detecting the state of inattention, 93.28%.},

abstract={Cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring is increasingly being needed for cardiovascular events management in clinical. Many of the existing methods, however, are based on manual feature extraction, which cannot characterize the complex relationship between the physiological signals and BP. In this study, the 16-layer VGGNet was used to construct cuff-less BP from electrocardiogram (ECG) and pressure pulse wave (PPW) signals, with no need extract features from raw signals. The deep network architecture has the ability of automatic feature learning, and the learned features are the higher-level abstract description of low-level raw physiological signals. Eight-nine middle-aged and elderly subjects were enrolled to evaluate the performance of the proposed BP estimation method, with oscillometric technique-based BP as a reference. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method had a commendable accuracy in BP estimation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and an estimation error of -2.06 ± 6.89 mmHg for systolic BP, and 0.89 and -4.66 ± 4.91 mmHg for diastolic BP. This study shows that the proposed method provided a potential novel insight for the cuff-less BP estimation.},

abstract={Whilst research efforts have traditionally focused on Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals and handcrafted features as potential biometric traits, few works have explored systems based on the raw pho-toplethysmogram (PPG) signal. This work proposes an end-to-end architecture to offer biometric authentication using PPG biosensors through Convolutional Networks. We provide an evaluation of the performance of our approach in two different databases: Troika and PulseID, the latter a publicly available database specifically collected by the authors for such a purpose. Our verification approach through convolutional network based models and using raw PPG signals appears to be viable in current monitoring procedures within e-health and fitness environments showing a remarkable potential as a biometry. The approach tested on a verification fashion, on trials lasting one second, achieved an AUC of 78.2% and 83.2%, averaged among target subjects, on PulseID and Troika datasets respectively. Our experimental results on previous small datasets support the usefulness of PPG extracted biomarkers as viable traits for multi-biometric or standalone biometrics. Furthermore, the approach results in a low input throughput and complexity that allows for a continuous authentication in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, the reported experiments also suggest that further research is necessary to account for and understand sources of variability found in some subjects.},

abstract={Sudden cardiac death is the result of abnormal heart conditions. Therefore, early detection of such abnormal conditions is vital to identify heart problems. Hence, in this paper, we aim to present a new computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) method based on time-frequency analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and deep neural networks for arrhythmia detection. Time-frequency transforms have the capability of providing spectral information at different times, which is very useful for analyzing non-stationary signals. On the other side, entropy is an attractive measurement from ECG signals which can distinguish different types of them. In this paper, time-frequency spectral entropy is proposed to extract the efficient features from ECG signals. All computed entropies cannot provide separability among different classes, two-directional two-dimensional principal component analysis (2D2PCA) can be used to reduce the dimension of the extracted features. Finally, the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifies the time-frequency features to diagnose the ECG beat signals and detect arrhythmias. The results show that the spectral entropy can provide good separation between different among ECG beats and the proposed method outperforms the recently introduced method for analyzing ECG signals.},

abstract={Excellent image quality is a primary prerequisite for diagnostic non-invasive coronary CT angiography. Artifacts due to cardiac motion may interfere with detection and diagnosis of coronary artery disease and render subsequent treatment decisions more difficult. We propose deep-learning-based measures for coronary motion artifact recognition and quantification in order to assess the diagnostic reliability and image quality of coronary CT angiography images. More specifically, the application, steering and evaluation of motion compensation algorithms can be triggered by these measures. A Coronary Motion Forward Artifact model for CT data (CoMoFACT) is developed and applied to clinical cases with excellent image quality to introduce motion artifacts using simulated motion vector fields. The data required for supervised learning is generated by the CoMoFACT from 17 prospectively ECG-triggered clinical cases with controlled motion levels on a scale of 0–10. Convolutional neural networks achieve an accuracy of 93.3% ± 1.8% for the classification task of separating motion-free from motion-perturbed coronary cross-sectional image patches. The target motion level is predicted by a corresponding regression network with a mean absolute error of 1.12 ± 0.07. Transferability and generalization capabilities are demonstrated by motion artifact measurements on eight additional CCTA cases with real motion artifacts.},

abstract={BackgroundThe electrocardiogram (ECG) has been widely used in the diagnosis of heart disease such as arrhythmia due to its simplicity and non-invasive nature. Arrhythmia can be classified into many types, including life-threatening and non-life-threatening. Accurate detection of arrhythmic types can effectively prevent heart disease and reduce mortality.MethodsIn this study, a novel deep learning method for classification of cardiac arrhythmia according to deep residual network (ResNet) is presented. We developed a 31-layer one-dimensional (1D) residual convolutional neural network. The algorithm includes four residual blocks, each of which consists of three 1D convolution layers, three batch normalization (BP) layers, three rectified linear unit (ReLU) layers, and an “identity shortcut connections” structure. In addition, we propose to use 2-lead ECG signals in combination with deep learning methods to automatically identify five different types of heartbeats.ResultsWe have obtained an average accuracy, sensitivity and positive predictivity of 99.06%, 93.21% and 96.76% respectively for single-lead ECG heartbeats. In the 2-lead datasets, the results show that the deep ResNet model has high classification performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.38%, sensitivity of 94.54%, and specificity of 98.14%.ConclusionThe proposed method can be used as an adjunct tool to assist clinicians in their diagnosis.},

abstract={Biometrics have been extensively used in the past decades in various security systems and have been deployed around the world. However, all unimodal biometrics have their own limitations and disadvantages (e.g., fingerprint suffers from spoof attacks). Most of these limitations can be addressed by designing a multimodal biometric system, which deploys over one biometric modality to improve the performance and make the system robust to spoof attacks. In this paper, we proposed a secure multimodal biometric system by fusing electrocardiogram (ECG) and fingerprint based on convolution neural network (CNN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to fuse ECG and fingerprint using CNN for human authentication. The feature extraction for individual modalities are performed using CNN and then biometric templates are generated from these features. After that, we have applied one of the cancelable biometric techniques to protect these templates. In the authentication stage, we proposed a Q-Gaussian multi support vector machine (QG-MSVM) as a classifier to improve the authentication performance. Dataset augmentation is successfully used to increase the authentication performance of the proposed system. Our system is tested on two databases, the PTB database from PhysioNet bank for ECG and LivDet2015 database for the fingerprint. Experimental results show that the proposed multimodal system is efficient, robust and reliable than existing multimodal authentication algorithms. According to the advantages of the proposed system, it can be deployed in real applications.},

abstract={Generally, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used in MI diagnosis. It has two unique attributes namely integrity and diversity. But most of the previous studies on automated MI diagnosis algorithm didn’t utilize these two attributes simultaneously. In this paper, a novel Multiple-Feature-Branch Convolutional Neural Network (MFB-CNN) is proposed for automated MI detection and localization using ECG. Each independent feature branch of the MFB-CNN corresponds to a certain lead. Individual features of a lead can be learned by a feature branch, exploiting the diversity among the 12 leads. Global fully-connected softmax layer can exploit the integrity, summarizing all the feature branches. Based on deep learning framework, no hand-designed features are required for analysis. Furthermore, patient-specific paradigm is adopted to manage the inter-patient variability, which is a significant challenge for automated diagnosis. Also, class-based experiment (regardless of the inter-patient variability) is performed. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the ECG data from PTB diagnostic database. It can achieve a good performance in MI diagnosis. For class-based MI detection and localization, the average accuracies are up to 99.95% and 99.81%, respectively; for patient-specific experiment, the average accuracies of MI detection and localization are 98.79% and 94.82%, respectively. Considering its excellent performance, the MFB-CNN can be applied to computer-aided diagnosis platform to assist the real-world MI detection and localization.},

abstract={Coronary artery disease (CAD) is caused due by the blockage of inner walls of coronary arteries by plaque. This constriction reduces the blood flow to the heart muscles resulting in myocardial infarction (MI). The electrocardiogram (ECG) is commonly used to screen the cardiac health. The ECG signals are nonstationary and nonlinear in nature whereby the transient disease indicators may appear randomly on the time scale. Therefore, the procedure to diagnose the abnormal beat is arduous, time consuming and prone to human errors. The automated diagnosis system overcomes these problems. In this study, convolutional neural network (CNN) structures comprising of four convolutional layers, four max pooling layers and three fully connected layers are proposed for the diagnosis of CAD using two and five seconds durations of ECG signal segments. Deep CNN is able to differentiate between normal and abnormal ECG with an accuracy of 94.95%, sensitivity of 93.72%, and specificity of 95.18% for Net 1 (two seconds) and accuracy of 95.11%, sensitivity of 91.13% and specificity of 95.88% for Net 2 (5s).

abstract={Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia, and its incidence increases with age. Many methods have been developed to identify AF, including both the hand-picked features by experts and the recent emerging artificial intelligent (AI) methods. As the traditional hand-picked features have almost reached the boundary of their capability, the AI methods have shown their great potentials to achieve high accuracy for the AF identification. However, some common AI methods, especially deep learning methods, do not provide good properties of interpretability, making it difficult to explore the internal relationship between input and prediction results. In addition, most of the reported methods are only for the intra-patient test of AF and Non-AF. In this study, we try to develop an AF detector based on a twin-attentional convolutional long short-term memory neural network (TAC-LSTM), which can not only generate results with high accuracy but also enable a human-friendly function to provide the possible explanations of the automated extracted features by AI. TAC-LSTM was applied to extract multi-domain features of ECG signals for AF detection and to mine the influence of different input segments on the final prediction results. Finally, the proposed method is validated on the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database (AFDB) with intra-patient test and inter-patient test and the results also have shown that multi-domain features extracted by TAC-LSTM can provide more useful information. Collectively, TAC-LSTM can be used for clinicians as an auxiliary diagnostic tool.},

abstract={Among various life-threatening cardiac disorders, ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are shockable ventricular cardiac arrhythmias (SVCA) which require immediate defibrillation therapy for the survival of patients. Timely and accurate detection of rapid VT or VF episodes using ECG signals is extremely important before initiating external defibrillator (AED) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapies. In this paper, a novel approach for the detection of SVCA using ECG signals is proposed. The fixed frequency range empirical wavelet transform (EWT) (FFREWT) filter-bank is introduced for the multiscale analysis of ECG signals. The modes evaluated using FFREWT of ECG signals are used as input to a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for the detection of SVCA. The architecture of the proposed deep CNN comprises of four convolution, two pooling, and four dense layers. The ECG signals from various public databases are used to evaluate the proposed FFREWT domain deep CNN approach. The results show that the proposed approach has obtained an accuracy of 99.036%, 99.800%, and 81.250% for the classification of shockable vs non-shockable, VF vs Non-VF, and VT vs VF, respectively using 8 s ECG frames with 10-fold cross-validation (CV) strategy. Our proposed approach has obtained an average accuracy value of 97.592% using 8 s ECG frames with subject-specific CV. The hardware implementation of the proposed SVCA detection approach can be done using an Internet of things (IoT) driven patient monitoring system.},

abstract={This article presents a new deep learning approach for cardiac arrhythmia (17 classes) detection based on long-duration electrocardiography (ECG) signal analysis. Cardiovascular disease prevention is one of the most important tasks of any health care system as about 50 million people are at risk of heart disease in the world. Although automatic analysis of ECG signal is very popular, current methods are not satisfactory. The goal of our research was to design a new method based on deep learning to efficiently and quickly classify cardiac arrhythmias. Described research are based on 1000 ECG signal fragments from the MIT - BIH Arrhythmia database for one lead (MLII) from 45 persons. Approach based on the analysis of 10-s ECG signal fragments (not a single QRS complex) is applied (on average, 13 times less classifications/analysis). A complete end-to-end structure was designed instead of the hand-crafted feature extraction and selection used in traditional methods. Our main contribution is to design a new 1D-Convolutional Neural Network model (1D-CNN). The proposed method is 1) efficient, 2) fast (real-time classification) 3) non-complex and 4) simple to use (combined feature extraction and selection, and classification in one stage). Deep 1D-CNN achieved a recognition overall accuracy of 17 cardiac arrhythmia disorders (classes) at a level of 91.33% and classification time per single sample of 0.015 s. Compared to the current research, our results are one of the best results to date, and our solution can be implemented in mobile devices and cloud computing.},

Therefore, in this work, we have proposed a novel tool for an automated differentiation of shockable and non-shockable ventricular arrhythmias from 2 s electrocardiogram (ECG) segments. Segmented ECGs are processed by an eleven-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Our proposed system was 10-fold cross validated and achieved maximum accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 93.18%, 95.32% and 91.04% respectively. Its high performance indicates that shockable life-threatening arrhythmia can be immediately detected and thus increase the chance of survival while CPR or AED-based support is performed. Our tool can also be seamlessly integrated with an ECG acquisition systems in the intensive care units (ICUs).},

abstract={BackgroundHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an uncommon but important cause of sudden cardiac death.ObjectivesThis study sought to develop an artificial intelligence approach for the detection of HCM based on 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG).MethodsA convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained and validated using digital 12-lead ECG from 2,448 patients with a verified HCM diagnosis and 51,153 non-HCM age- and sex-matched control subjects. The ability of the CNN to detect HCM was then tested on a different dataset of 612 HCM and 12,788 control subjects.ResultsIn the combined datasets, mean age was 54.8 ± 15.9 years for the HCM group and 57.5 ± 15.5 years for the control group. After training and validation, the area under the curve (AUC) of the CNN in the validation dataset was 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94 to 0.97) at the optimal probability threshold of 11% for having HCM. When applying this probability threshold to the testing dataset, the CNN’s AUC was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.95 to 0.96) with sensitivity 87% and specificity 90%. In subgroup analyses, the AUC was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.94 to 0.97) among patients with left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG criteria and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.90 to 1.00) among patients with a normal ECG. The model performed particularly well in younger patients (sensitivity 95%, specificity 92%). In patients with HCM with and without sarcomeric mutations, the model-derived median probabilities for having HCM were 97% and 96%, respectively.ConclusionsECG-based detection of HCM by an artificial intelligence algorithm can be achieved with high diagnostic performance, particularly in younger patients. This model requires further refinement and external validation, but it may hold promise for HCM screening.},

abstract={The recent advances in ECG sensor devices provide opportunities for user self-managed auto-diagnosis and monitoring services over the internet. This imposes the requirements for generic ECG classification methods that are inter-patient and device independent. In this paper, we present our work on using the densely connected convolutional neural network (DenseNet) and gated recurrent unit network (GRU) for addressing the inter-patient ECG classification problem. A deep learning model architecture is proposed and is evaluated using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and Supraventricular Databases. The results obtained show that without applying any complicated data pre-processing or feature engineering methods, both of our models have considerably outperformed the state-of-the-art performance for supraventricular (SVEB) and ventricular (VEB) arrhythmia classifications on the unseen testing dataset (with the F1 score improved from 51.08 to 61.25 for SVEB detection and from 88.59 to 89.75 for VEB detection respectively). As no patient-specific or device-specific information is used at the training stage in this work, it can be considered as a more generic approach for dealing with scenarios in which varieties of ECG signals are collected from different patients using different types of sensor devices.},

abstract={Biometric identification via Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, which can be captured by devices with ECG sensors, have been explored for human identification for decades. Whereas, the problems of generalization and efficiency for ECG biometric recognition are still challenging. In this paper, we propose a new generic convolutional neural network (CNN) approach (i.e., Cascaded CNN) to realize human identification via ECG biometric identification. In our method, two CNNs are trained progressively. The first CNN called F-CNN is used for feature extraction of ECG heartbeats, and the second one called M-CNN is used for biometric comparison (identification). The trained F-CNN and M-CNN are cascaded to compose the Cascaded CNN as the final identification network. One of the main characteristics of the proposed method is the strong generalization ability. Once the Cascaded CNN is constructed, it can be used for various groups with variable number of members for human identification, which meets the practical demands greatly. Experiments are conducted on five public datasets in PhysioNet to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. By the Cascaded CNN, an average identification rate of 94.3% is achieved without re-training and any fine-tuning for the four test datasets. Moreover, only two milliseconds are needed for once comparison operation. Because of the generalization ability and real-time efficiency, it is feasible to promote the application of the proposed method for biometric identification via ECG in practice.},

abstract={The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a useful diagnostic tool to diagnose various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as myocardial infarction (MI). The ECG records the heart's electrical activity and these signals are able to reflect the abnormal activity of the heart. However, it is challenging to visually interpret the ECG signals due to its small amplitude and duration. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to automatically detect the MI using ECG signals. In this study, we implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm for the automated detection of a normal and MI ECG beats (with noise and without noise). We achieved an average accuracy of 93.53% and 95.22% using ECG beats with noise and without noise removal respectively. Further, no feature extraction or selection is performed in this work. Hence, our proposed algorithm can accurately detect the unknown ECG signals even with noise. So, this system can be introduced in clinical settings to aid the clinicians in the diagnosis of MI.},

abstract={The most prevalent arrhythmia observed in clinical practice is atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is associated with an irregular heartbeat pattern and a lack of a distinct P-waves signal. A low-cost method for identifying this condition is the use of a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as the gold standard for AF diagnosis, after annotation by experts. However, manual interpretation of these signals may be subjective and susceptible to inter-observer variabilities because many non-AF rhythms exhibit irregular RR-intervals and lack P-waves similar to AF. Furthermore, the acquired surface ECG signal is always contaminated by noise. Hence, highly accurate and robust detection of AF using short-term, single-lead ECG is valuable but challenging. To improve the existing model, this paper proposes a simple algorithm of a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coupled with one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs) to classify three classes: Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR), AF and non-AF (NAF). The experiment was conducted with a combination of three public datasets and one dataset from an Indonesian hospital. The robustness of the proposed model was evaluated based on several validation data with an unseen pattern from 4 datasets. The results indicated that 1D-CNNs outperformed other approaches and achieved satisfactory performances with high generalization ability. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-Score for two classes were 99.98%, 99.91%, 99.91%, 99.99%, and 99.95%, respectively. For the three classes, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-Score was 99.17%, 98.90%, 99.17%, 96.74%, and 97.48%, respectively. Potentially, our approach can aid AF diagnosis in clinics and patient self-monitoring to improve early detection and effective treatment of AF.},

abstract={Automatic arrhythmia detection based on electrocardiogram (ECG) is of great significance for early prevention and diagnosis of cardiac diseases. Recently, deep learning methods have been applied to arrhythmia detection and obtained great success. Among them, convolutional neural network (CNN) is an effective method for extracting features due to its local connectivity and parameter sharing. In addition, recurrent neural network (RNN) is another commonly used method, which is applied to process time-series signal. The stacking of both CNN and RNN has been proved to be more effective in multi-class arrhythmia detection. However, these networks ignored the fact that different channels and temporal segments of a feature map extracted from the 12-lead ECG signal contribute differently to cardiac arrhythmia detection, and thus, the classification performance could be greatly improved. To address this issue, spatio-temporal attention-based convolutional recurrent neural network (STA-CRNN) is proposed to focus on representative features along both spatial and temporal axes. STA-CRNN consists of CNN subnetwork, spatio-temporal attention modules and RNN subnetwork. The experiment result shows that, STA-CRNN reaches an average F1 score of 0.835 in classifying 8 types of arrhythmias and normal rhythm. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods based on the same public dataset, STA-CRNN achieves an obvious improvement on identifying most of arrhythmias. Also, it is demonstrated by visualization that the learned features through STA-CRNN are in line with clinical judgement. STA-CRNN provides a promising method for automatic arrhythmia detection, which has a potential to assist cardiologists in the diagnosis of arrhythmias.},

abstract={A biometrics-based authentication system is usually a better security solution than traditional systems which are heavily reliant on passwords, personal identification numbers or smart cards. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most promising approaches for biometrics-based authentication in recent years, because, unlike other biometrics, it assures aliveness of the person being authenticated. In this paper, we present a novel authentication system using an efficient feature detection algorithm and a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on ECG for human authentication. Our system processes ECG signals through two main phases: a feature detection phase and an authentication phase. In the feature detection phase, preprocessing was performed first to remove as much noise as possible and straighten the ECG signals. Then, the proposed scanning and removing methods are used to extract the main features from the signals that have negative peaks, high-grade noise and baseline drifts with higher accuracy than existing algorithms. In the authentication phase, we proposed a 12-layer CNN to authenticate the ECG signals. We also introduced a new database (MWM-HIT database), which is suitable for training and validating authentication systems. In addition, we used all records from the PTB, CYBHi, and MIT-BIH arrhythmia databases for comparison between the proposed system and other systems. We achieved an average accuracy, sensitivity and positive predictivity of 97.92%, 96.96% and 98.79%, respectively for detecting all peaks on all records from the collected database and an accuracy of 99.96%, sensitivity of 99.99% and positive predictivity of 99.98% for detecting all peaks on the MIT-BIH database for ten seconds of lead II ECG signals. The proposed model is able to authenticate the ECG signals with an equal error rate (EER) of 1.63%, 4.47%, and 4.86% when using lead II from PTB, CYBHi and the collected databases, respectively. The proposed system is highly usable in a real-time authentication system.},

abstract={This paper presents a new End-to-End Deep Learning method for heart diseases diagnosis from single channel ECG signal. Motivated by the great efficiency and popularity of deep learning algorithms for time series classification, the proposed work is mainly based on the One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN). Unlike the traditional CNN models based classification, a new Multi-Level Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks (ML-WCNN) is proposed to recognize automatically various types of cardiac arrhythmias. The proposed approach incorporates the 1D-CNN model and the Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) to extract discriminative features from different wavelet sub-bands and from the raw ECG signal simultaneously. The extracted features by the ML-WCNN model are then merged using different fusion strategies, especially by concatenation and maximization. This improves greatly the features learning process at different scales of the ECG signal, providing better diagnosis performances. The proposed ML-WCNN framework is evaluated on the Standard Database MIT-BIH Arrhythmia considering six classes of heart Beats: Normal (N), Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC), Right Bundle Brunch Block (RBBB), Left Bundle Brunch Block (LBBB), Atrial Premature Contraction (APC) and Paced beats (PAC). The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ML-WCNN, in comparison with the state-of-the-art heart diseases diagnosis based Machine/Deep learning algorithms, with a maximum Accuracy of 99.57% using the 10-fold cross validation technique.},

abstract={Background and objectiveSleep apnea is a common sleep disorder, usually diagnosed using an expensive, highly specialized, and inconvenient test called polysomnography. A single SpO2 sensor based on an automated classification system can be developed to simplify the apnea detection. The main objective of this work is to develop a classifier based on a convolution neural network with the capability of detecting apnea events from one dimensional SpO2 signal. However, to find an optimum convolution neural network structure is a daunting task is usually done by a trial-and-error method. To solve this problem, a method is proposed to save time and simplify the process of searching for an optimum convolution neural network structure.MethodsGreedy based optimization is proposed to search for an optimized convolution neural network structure. Three different variants of greedy based optimization are proposed: the topology transfer, the weighted-topology transfer with rough estimation, and the weighted-topology transfer with fine tuning. The subject independent and the cross-database test are performed for the analysis.ResultsConsidering the balance between the execution time and the performance, the weighted-topology transfer with rough estimation is the best. An accuracy of 88.49% for the HuGCDN2008 database and 95.14% for the Apnea-ECG database are obtained for apnea events detection per minute. Regarding the apnea patient detection, also referred to as global classification, an accuracy of 95.71% is achieved for the HuGCDN2008 database, and 100% is achieved for the AED database without removing any subjects from both databases.ConclusionsThe proposed one-dimensional convolution neural network performs better in a similar situation than those presented in the literature. The greedy based methods, mainly the weighted-topology transfer with rough estimation, is an alternative method to extensive trial and error method.},

abstract={The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an effective tool for cardiovascular disease diagnosis and arrhythmia detection. Most methods proposed in the literature include the following steps: 1) denoizing, 2) segmentation into heartbeats, 3) feature extraction, and 4) classification. In this paper, we present a deep learning method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. CNN models can perform feature extraction automatically and jointly with the classification step. In other words, our proposed method does not require a feature extraction step with hand-crafted techniques. Our proposed method is also based on an algorithm for heartbeat segmentation that is different from most existing methods. In particular, the segmentation algorithm defines each ECG heartbeat to start at an R-peak and end after 1.2 times the median RR time interval in a 10-s window. This method is simple and effective, as it does not use any form of filtering or processing that requires assumptions about the signal morphology or spectrum. Although enhanced ECG heartbeat classification algorithms have been proposed in the literature, they failed to achieve high performance in detecting some heartbeat categories, especially for imbalanced datasets. To overcome this challenge, we propose an optimization step for the deep CNN model using a novel loss function called focal loss. This function focuses on minority heartbeat classes by increasing their importance. We trained and evaluated our proposed model with the MIT-BIH and INCART datasets to identify five arrhythmia categories (N, S, V, Q, and F) based on the Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard. The evaluation results revealed that the focal loss function improved the classification accuracy for the minority classes as well as the overall metrics. Our proposed method achieved 98.41% overall accuracy, 98.38% overall F1-score, 98.37% overall precision, and 98.41% overall recall. In addition, our method achieved better performance than that of existing state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a severe pathophysiological condition associated with high prevalence, high mortality rates, and sustained healthcare costs, therefore demanding efficient methods for its detection. Despite recent research has provided methods focused on advanced signal processing and machine learning, the potential of applying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approaches to the automatic detection of CHF has been largely overlooked thus far. This study addresses this important gap by presenting a CNN model that accurately identifies CHF on the basis of one raw electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeat only, also juxtaposing existing methods typically grounded on Heart Rate Variability. We trained and tested the model on publicly available ECG datasets, comprising a total of 490,505 heartbeats, to achieve 100% CHF detection accuracy. Importantly, the model also identifies those heartbeat sequences and ECG’s morphological characteristics which are class-discriminative and thus prominent for CHF detection. Overall, our contribution substantially advances the current methodology for detecting CHF and caters to clinical practitioners’ needs by providing an accurate and fully transparent tool to support decisions concerning CHF detection.},

abstract={The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a standard test used to monitor the activity of the heart. Many cardiac abnormalities will be manifested in the ECG including arrhythmia which is a general term that refers to an abnormal heart rhythm. The basis of arrhythmia diagnosis is the identification of normal versus abnormal individual heart beats, and their correct classification into different diagnoses, based on ECG morphology. Heartbeats can be sub-divided into five categories namely non-ectopic, supraventricular ectopic, ventricular ectopic, fusion, and unknown beats. It is challenging and time-consuming to distinguish these heartbeats on ECG as these signals are typically corrupted by noise. We developed a 9-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically identify 5 different categories of heartbeats in ECG signals. Our experiment was conducted in original and noise attenuated sets of ECG signals derived from a publicly available database. This set was artificially augmented to even out the number of instances the 5 classes of heartbeats and filtered to remove high-frequency noise. The CNN was trained using the augmented data and achieved an accuracy of 94.03% and 93.47% in the diagnostic classification of heartbeats in original and noise free ECGs, respectively. When the CNN was trained with highly imbalanced data (original dataset), the accuracy of the CNN reduced to 89.07%% and 89.3% in noisy and noise-free ECGs. When properly trained, the proposed CNN model can serve as a tool for screening of ECG to quickly identify different types and frequency of arrhythmic heartbeats.},

abstract={The early detection of abnormal heart rhythm has become crucial due to the spike in the rate of deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases. While many existing works tried to classify heartbeats accurately, they suffered from the imbalance between heartbeat classes in the available ECG datasets since abnormal heartbeats appear much less frequently than normal ones. In addition, most of existing methods heavily rely on data preprocessing such as noise removal and feature extraction, which is computationally expensive, thus limits their use on low-cost portable ECG devices. We present a novel deep convolutional neural network based on state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for accurate heartbeat classification. We suggest a batch-weighted loss function to better quantify the loss in order to overcome the imbalance between classes. The loss weights dynamically change as the distribution of classes in each batch changes. Also, we propose to use multiple heartbeats for more effective heartbeat classification. Even though we use ECG signal from one lead only without any data preprocessing, our method consistently outperforms existing methods of 5-class heartbeat classification. Our accuracy, positive productivity, sensitivity and specificity under intra-patient paradigm are 99.48%, 98.83%, 96.97% and 99.87%, and those under inter-patient paradigm are 88.34%, 48.25%, 90.90% and 88.51% respectively.},

abstract={Arrhythmias are a group of common conditions associated with irregular heart rhythms. Some of these conditions, for instance, atrial fibrillation (AF), might develop into serious syndromes if not treated in time. Therefore, for high-risk patients, early detection of arrhythmias is crucial. In this study, we propose employing deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithms for real-time arrhythmia detection. We first build a full-precision deep convolutional network model. With our proposed construction, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art level performance on the PhysioNet/CinC AF Classification Challenge 2017 dataset with our full-precision model. It is desirable to employ models with low computing resource requirements. It has been shown that a binarized model requires much less computing power and memory space than a full-precision model. We proceed to verify the feasibility of binarization in our neural network model. Network binarization can cause significant model performance degradation. Therefore, we propose employing a full-precision model as the teacher to regularize the training of the binarized model through knowledge distillation. With our proposed approach, we observe that network binarization only causes a small performance loss (the F1 score decreases from 0.88 to 0.87 for the validation set). Given that binarized convolutional networks can achieve favorable model performance while dramatically reducing computing cost, they are ideal for deployment on long-term cardiac condition monitoring devices.

abstract={Fibrillations and flutters are serious diseases influence the normal functioning of the heart. Among the most frequently occurring heart disorders belong atrial fibrillation (Afib), atrial flutter (Afl), and ventricular fibrillation (Vfib). Nowadays, heart failures are mostly detected by electrocardiogram (ECG) device by examining the signal transferred from electrodes placed on the human body to the output display. The signal is examined by professional health personnel, who are looking for an obvious pattern representing the normal or abnormal rhythm of the heart. Nevertheless, information from ECG can be distorted by noise on data transmission. Moreover,problematic pattern does not have to be so much different from normal and it can be difficult to recognize them just by human eye even by an expert in the field. An automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is an approach to make decision support for elimination of these lacks. For early diagnosis, CAD tool should work in like real-time system without big time consuming and dependency on data and measuring differences of each device. This paper proposes a novel approach of a CAD system to the detection of fibrillations and flutters by our 8-layer deep convolutional neural network. Proposed model requires only basic data normalization without pre-processing and feature extraction from raw ECG samples. We have achieved the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of 98.45%, 99.27%, and 99.87% respectively. Designed system can be directly implemented like decision support system in clinical environment.},

abstract={Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are two common life-threatening arrhythmias. Both are not only easily transformed into each other, but also often cause misdiagnosis due to the similar clinical symptoms. The early efficient and accurate detection of AF and AFL is helpful to reduce the pain and injury of patients suffering from these diseases, and the traditional detection is often inefficient and laborious. Therefore, we propose a new model mechanism using an 11-layers network architecture to automatically classify AF and AFL signals. It is mainly constructed with the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the improved Elman neural network (IENN). Besides, we specifically design two relative models as control subjects to validate the classification performance of the proposed model. 10-fold cross-validation is also implemented on the MIT-BIH AF database (AFDB) and the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB), respectively. The obtained results show that the model achieved the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of 98.8%, 98.6%, and 98.9% on the AFDB database and 99.4%, 99.1%, and 99.6% on the MITDB database, respectively. The model mechanism has been demonstrated to have more superior performance than two relative models and some advanced algorithms, which can be considered as a reliable and efficient identification system to aid physicians and save lives.},

abstract={Driver distraction is a major cause of road accidents which can lead to severe physical injuries and death. Statistics indicate the need of a reliable driver distraction system which can monitor the driver׳s distraction in real time and alert the driver before a mishap happens. Early detection of driver distraction can help decrease the costs of roadway disasters. There has been large research efforts towards analyzing driving behavior or monitoring driver distraction using camera-based techniques. However, camera-based systems pose challenges such as privacy and latency in the signs of distraction. Physiological signals such as Electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate related measures have been extensively used to monitor human state at a physiological level and developed systems which alert divers well in advance. In this paper, we introduce an ECG based driver distraction detection system using Mel-frequency cepstrum representation and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The proposed model operates by feeding a two dimensional Mel-frequency cepstrum representation of ECG data as input to deep convolutional neural networks. We present a recipe to extract Mel frequency filter bank coefficients in time and frequency domains. The deep CNN is structured to automatically learn reliable discriminative patterns in the 2D spectro-temporal space as features thus replacing the traditional ad hoc hand-crafted features when working with the recorded time-series dataset. The classification accuracy of the proposed prediction algorithm was evaluated for ECG signals recorded from 10 subjects. The subjects aged 24 to 45, actively participated in the naturalistic driving experiment during the ECG recordings. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a significant classification accuracy for across the subjects.},

abstract={Electrocardiogram (ECG) is gaining increased attention as a biometric method in a wide range of applications, such as access control and security/privacy requirements. The majority of reported investigations using the ECG biometric method are usually based on fiducial or nonfiducial methods, which are always accompanied by a series of issues, such as locating fiducial points accurately is difficult, feature selection is subjective, and classifiers are limited by the quantity and structure of data. This paper proposes a new biometric authentication system for human identification that uses ECG signals as a biometric trait and integrates a generalized S-transformation and a convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, we first introduce a blind segmentation strategy that effectively avoids difficult data-specific heartbeat recognition and segmentation techniques. Then, a generalized S-transformation is performed on the blind signal-processed ECG signal, capturing the ECG trajectory at each time point in the frequency domain. Next, the getframe technology is used to capture an image of the ECG trajectories and convert the one-dimensional signal to a two-dimensional image, which serves as the input layer of the CNN, thus fully reflecting the changing trend in the ECG signal spectrum characteristics over a continuous period. Finally, the CNN is used for automatic discriminative feature learning and representations, which avoids a tedious feature extraction algorithm. In addition, considering the possible impact of ECG signals with different signal behaviors on identification, experiments are performed on three ECG databases with diverse features, comprising normal individuals, atrial fibrillation patients, and a noisy database, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Promising identification rates of 99%, 98%, and 99% were achieved, respectively. Thus, our proposed ECG authentication system can be effectively used for identity recognition under various conditions.},

abstract={Automatic arrhythmia detection from Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays an important role in early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a simpler, more noise-immune solution than traditional methods in multi-class arrhythmia classification. However, suffering from lack of consideration for temporal feature of ECG signal, CNN couldn’t accept varied-length ECG signal and had limited performance in detecting paroxysmal arrhythmias. To address these issues, we proposed attention-based time-incremental convolutional neural network (ATI-CNN), a deep neural network model achieving both spatial and temporal fusion of information from ECG signals by integrating CNN, recurrent cells and attention module. Comparing to CNN model, this model features flexible input length, halved parameter amount as well as more than 90% computation reduction in real-time processing. The experiment result shows that, ATI-CNN reached an overall classification accuracy of 81.2%. In comparison with a classical 16-layer CNN named VGGNet, ATI-CNN achieved accuracy increases of 7.7% in average and up to 26.8% in detecting paroxysmal arrhythmias. Combining all these excellent features, ATI-CNN offered an exemplification for all kinds of varied-length signal processing problems.},

abstract={Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the main causes of life-threatening heart disease. Its detection and diagnosis have been highly concerned by physicians in recent years. However, the conventional AF detection through visual inspection of electrocardiogram (ECG) data by expert cardiologists is low-efficient and time-consuming. In this work, we develop a novel approach for the automated AF detection based on an 11-layers neural network. The network structure is primarily stacked by convolutional neural network (CNN) and the modified Elman neural network (MENN), while automatically performing end-to-end signals classification. To verify the superiority of the proposed model, two relevant deep network models were specially constructed for comparison. Moreover, ten-fold cross-validation was employed to evaluate the classification performance of the model on the MIT-BIH AF database. Compared with the two relevant models and several state-of-the-art methods, the model yielded excellent classification performance with the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 97.4%, 97.9%, and 97.1%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first time to stack CNN and MENN for ECG signals analysis and AF detection in particular. Its outstanding performance demonstrates that the proposed model has great potential as an efficient and robust identification system to assist physicians and reduce mortality.},

Machine and deep learning methods are commonly used in AF detection.ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the information provided by convolutional neural network (CNN) and random forest (RF) machine learning models for AF classification.MethodsWe manually extracted 166 time–frequency domains and linear and nonlinear features to classify single-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) as normal, AF, other, or noisy sinus rhythms. We selected a subset of 56 robust features using a genetic algorithm that was used in the RF model. In a separate study, a 1-dimensional, 12-layer CNN was designed on the raw ECG rhythms. Four features from the output layer and 128 features from the fully connected layer of CNN were explored independently for classification. The models were trained and internally validated on 8,528 ECGs and externally validated on a hidden dataset containing 3,658 ECGs. Next,we analyzed the correlation between engineered and CNN-learned features.ResultsAn RF classifier trained with 56-engineered features resulted in an F1 score of 0.91, 0.78, and 0.72 for normal, AF, and other rhythms, respectively. However, an ensemble of support vector machine and the CNN model resulted in an F1 score of 0.92, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively.ConclusionWe explored various features and machine learning models to identify AF rhythms using short (9–61 seconds) single-lead ECG recordings. Our results showed that the proposed CNN model abstracted distinctive features for AF classification.},

abstract={Our cardiovascular system weakens and is more prone to arrhythmia as we age. An arrhythmia is an abnormal heartbeat rhythm which can be life-threatening. Atrial fibrillation (Afib), atrial flutter (Afl), and ventricular fibrillation (Vfib) are the recurring life-threatening arrhythmias that affect the elderly population. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is the principal diagnostic tool employed to record and interpret ECG signals. These signals contain information about the different types of arrhythmias. However, due to the complexity and non-linearity of ECG signals, it is difficult to manually analyze these signals. Moreover, the interpretation of ECG signals is subjective and might vary between the experts. Hence, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system is proposed. The CAD system will ensure that the assessment of ECG signals is objective and accurate. In this work, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) technique to automatically detect the different ECG segments. Our algorithm consists of an eleven-layer deep CNN with the output layer of four neurons, each representing the normal (Nsr), Afib, Afl, and Vfib ECG class. In this work, we have used ECG signals of two seconds and five seconds’ durations without QRS detection. We achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 92.50%, 98.09%, and 93.13% respectively for two seconds of ECG segments. We obtained an accuracy of 94.90%, the sensitivity of 99.13%, and specificity of 81.44% for five seconds of ECG duration. This proposed algorithm can serve as an adjunct tool to assist clinicians in confirming their diagnosis.},

abstract={Medical diagnosis is the process of determining a patient’s health condition by the observation of symptoms and test results. Cardiovascular diseases are one of the most common causes of death worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the effective ways for diagnosing heart conditions. ECG records and detects the strength and timing of electrical activity of the heart. A proper diagnosis can reduce mortality rate. Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown its inexplicable contribution in the field of medical science, especially in diagnosis. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is the most popular deep learning algorithm, which captures the relevant features by itself. Deep learning requires a massive amount of data to train the network, which increases the computational complexity. This chapter aims to reduce the computational complexity. We consider the cardiac diseases such as arrhythmia and myocardial infarction (MI) for our experimental analysis. We have used heartbeat segmented and preprocessed ECG data available at Kaggle. We aim to reduce the computational complexity of the existing deep learning architecture for cardiac disease classification by using the feature-extracted data. We propose the single-layer CNN for the classification of ECG beats of arrhythmia and MI. We also evaluated the performance of the proposed model by using the following evaluation metrics: precision, recall, and F1 score. The performance of the proposed architecture is high compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

Efficient and accurate diagnosis of AF based on the ECG is valuable in clinical settings and remains challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel method with high reliability and accuracy for AF detection via deep learning.MethodThe short-term Fourier transform (STFT) and stationary wavelet transform (SWT) were used to analyze ECG segments to obtain two-dimensional (2-D) matrix input suitable for deep convolutional neural networks. Then, two different deep convolutional neural network models corresponding to STFT output and SWT output were developed. Our new method did not require detection of P or R peaks, nor feature designs for classification, in contrast to existing algorithms. Finally, the performances of the two models were evaluated and compared with those of existing algorithms.ResultsOur proposed method demonstrated favorable performances on ECG segments as short as 5 s. The deep convolutional neural network using input generated by STFT, presented a sensitivity of 98.34%, specificity of 98.24% and accuracy of 98.29%. For the deep convolutional neural network using input generated by SWT, a sensitivity of 98.79%, specificity of 97.87% and accuracy of 98.63% was achieved.ConclusionThe proposed method using deep convolutional neural networks shows high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, and, therefore, is a valuable tool for AF detection.},
